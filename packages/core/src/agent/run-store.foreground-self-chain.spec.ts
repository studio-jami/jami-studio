/**
 * SQL invariants behind the foreground self-chain
 * (`AGENT_CHAT_FOREGROUND_SELF_CHAIN`) — the "no double-run when the client
 * also continues" proof, exercised against a real SQLite engine (so the
 * conditional UPDATE / rowsAffected semantics are real, not mocked).
 *
 * The handoff protocol (see `chainServerDrivenContinuation` in
 * production-agent.ts): the finishing chunk PRE-INSERTS the successor row
 * (`dispatch_mode='background'`, status running, same thread + turn) BEFORE
 * the terminal `auto_continue` is ever emitted to the client (run-manager
 * emits terminal events only after onComplete). So by the time the client
 * could fire its own continuation re-POST, the successor row already exists —
 * and these tests pin that:
 *   1. `tryClaimRunSlot` refuses a racing client continuation POST for the
 *      whole handoff window (unclaimed AND claimed successor states), pointing
 *      it at the successor run to reconnect to instead (the 409 → adopt path).
 *   2. Duplicate deliveries of the successor dispatch dedupe via the atomic
 *      `claimBackgroundRun` CAS — at most one executes.
 *   3. When the handoff fails LOUDLY (successor errored), the thread slot is
 *      free again so the client's existing auto_continue re-POST fallback can
 *      proceed — a failed self-chain never deadlocks the turn.
 *   4. A successor whose dispatch was silently lost is covered by the SAME
 *      unclaimed-background reaper machinery as durable-background handoffs
 *      (`listUnclaimedBackgroundRunIds` + `reapUnclaimedBackgroundRun`).
