/**
 * Client-side session gate for an authenticated app shell.
 *
 * Wrap a template's private app shell with <RequireSession> so a logged-out
 * visitor is sent to the framework sign-in page instead of being left staring
 * at an infinite loading spinner.
 *
 * Why this exists in addition to the server-side auth guard (`runAuthGuard`,
 * which serves the onboarding/sign-in HTML for unauthenticated requests):
 * the server guard only protects requests that actually reach the Nitro
 * function. A statically-served / CDN-cached SPA shell, or a client-side
 * (React Router) navigation made after the session expired, never re-hits the
 * guard — so the app boots with no session, every data query 401s, and the UI
 * sticks on its loading state forever. This component closes that gap by
 * resolving the session on the client and redirecting when there is none.
 *
 * Place it INSIDE your providers (so the fallback is themed) but AROUND the
 * routed app layout:
 *
 *   <AppProviders ...>
 *     <RequireSession>
 *       <AppLayout><Outlet /></AppLayout>
 *     </RequireSession>
 *   </AppProviders>
 *
 * Templates with public/anonymous routes (share pages, embeds) must NOT wrap
 * their whole app — gate only the private subtree, or pass `bypass` for the
 * surfaces that authenticate by another mechanism.
