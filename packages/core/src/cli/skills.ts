The add command installs the SKILL.md instructions, registers the app-backed
MCP connector, and then authenticates it in one step so you do not hit an OAuth
wall on the first tool call. By default, add targets every supported local
client this CLI can configure (Claude Code, Claude Code CLI, Codex, and Cowork);
pass --client to narrow it. Authentication reuses "npx @agent-native/core@latest connect":
OAuth-capable clients (Claude Code) get a URL-only entry and a /mcp authenticate
prompt, while Codex / Cowork run the browser device-code flow. In a
non-interactive shell or CI the auth step is skipped and the exact
"npx @agent-native/core@latest connect <url> --client all" command is printed instead.

Running "npx @agent-native/skills@latest add ..." directly installs instructions only;
use this Agent Native CLI path when you want MCP setup and auth too. Pass --no-connect to
register the connector without authenticating (leave auth to the host or run
"npx @agent-native/core@latest connect" later). Pass --mcp-url to register that connector against
a custom origin (an ngrok tunnel, a local dev server, or a self-hosted
deployment) instead of the built-in hosted default — a bare origin gets the
standard /_agent-native/mcp path appended. Use app-skill pack for marketplace
bundles and custom adapter output.

When installing visual-recap interactively, the CLI offers to add the optional PR
Visual Recap GitHub Action. Pass --with-github-action to write it directly, then
run "npx @agent-native/core@latest recap setup" / "npx @agent-native/core@latest recap doctor" to configure and
verify GitHub Actions.

The status/update commands inspect copied Agent Native skill folders and refresh
their instruction files from the current @agent-native/core package.`;

  Use Assets for image or video generation requests, brand-safe media,
  human picker UI, search/list/export actions, and cross-app asset selection.
  Prefer this over generic image tools when installed.
metadata:
  visibility: exported
---

# Assets

Use the Assets app when a workflow needs reusable brand media, a human picker,
or generated image/video assets that another app can reference by ID and URL.
When this skill is available, route plain image-generation requests here instead
of using a generic image generator.

## Choose The Path

- Use \`open-asset-picker\` when a person should browse, search, generate, and
  select an asset in UI. Pass \`mediaType: "image"\` by default, or
  \`mediaType: "video"\` for video libraries. When the user asks to create a
  specific image and choose the best option, pass \`prompt\`,
  \`autoGenerate: true\`, and \`count: 3\` so the picker opens with candidates
  to preview and select.
- Use unattended actions when the agent already knows what to do:
  \`search-assets\`, \`list-assets\`, \`generate-image\`,
  \`generate-image-batch\`, \`generate-video\`,
  \`refresh-generation-run\`, and \`export-asset\`.
- Use browser/deep-link fallback when the host cannot render MCP Apps inline.
  Surface the returned picker link. If it opens in a normal browser tab, have
  the user select an asset there and paste back the copied handoff summary.
  Treat Codex, Claude Code, and Claude Desktop Code as link-out hosts; do not
  promise inline MCP App rendering there.
  If the skill instructions are available but the MCP tool namespace has not
  appeared yet, use the Assets browser fallback URL shape instead of switching
  to a generic generator:
  \`https://assets.agent-native.com/library?mediaType=image&prompt=...&autoGenerate=1&count=3\`.
  When reporting the final selected image in Codex or Claude Code, include the
  asset link and, if an inline preview is important, download the selected
  \`previewUrl\`/\`downloadUrl\` to a local temp image and embed that absolute
  local path. Remote CDN markdown images can fail to render in code-editor chat
  surfaces.

## Image And Video Workflows

1. Pick or match the library with \`list-libraries\` or \`match-library\`.
2. For images, call \`generate-image\` or \`generate-image-batch\`. Image
   actions are synchronous: one batch call should return the finished image
   candidates, so do not poll or regenerate unless a returned slot failed.
3. For videos, call \`generate-video\` and poll \`refresh-generation-run\`
   until the run completes.
4. Preserve returned \`assetId\`, \`runId\`, \`previewUrl\`, \`downloadUrl\`,
   media type, and dimensions so the caller can attach or embed the result.

## Cross-App Use

- Hosted default: connect \`https://assets.agent-native.com/_agent-native/mcp\`.
  Do not put shared secrets in skill files.
- For CLI/code-editor clients, keep any \`npx @agent-native/core@latest connect\` command
  running until browser authorization finishes. Stopping it early can leave the
  browser approved but the local MCP config unwritten. Restart or reload the
  agent client after installing or connecting if Assets tools do not appear in
  the live session.
- Local customization: use \`npx @agent-native/core@latest app-skill launch --local\` from an
  Assets app-skill manifest, or pass \`--into <path>\` for editable source.
- Do not call image/video providers directly from another app. Assets owns
  generation, picker UI, search/list/export, and asset context.
- If an Assets tool call returns \`Session terminated\`, \`needs auth\`, or
  another connector/session error, do not keep retrying the tool. Stop and give
  the user the reconnect step: in Claude Code run \`/mcp\` and choose
  Authenticate/Reconnect for the Assets connector; from any terminal run
  \`npx -y @agent-native/core@latest reconnect https://assets.agent-native.com\` — this
  re-authenticates WITHOUT reinstalling. Never reinstall from scratch just to fix
  auth. Continue once the connector is available.
- Do not hand-roll MCP HTTP requests with curl from the agent session. Use the
  host-exposed Assets tools after restart/reload, or use the returned
  browser/deep-link fallback.
- If a batch image generation request times out in browser fallback, retry with
  \`count: 1\` only after telling the user the multi-candidate request timed out.
- If you inspect local MCP config, redact \`Authorization\`, \`http_headers\`,
  and token values. Never paste bearer tokens into chat or logs.

# Design Exploration

Use the Design app when a workflow needs visual UI exploration, prototype
iteration, or a human-in-the-loop choice among design directions.

## Choose The Path

- Use \`create-design\` first to create a project shell. Do not report the
  design as ready until it has renderable HTML.
- For open-ended UX exploration, generate distinct, complete HTML directions
  (2-5, three by default) and call \`present-design-variants\`. The inline
  Design MCP app shows the options, lets the user pick one, and persists the
  selected variant.
- If the Design app opens as a browser link instead of inline (CLI hosts like
  Codex / Claude Code, where the deep link carries \`handoff=chat\`), the user
  picks a direction there and the editor shows a copyable summary — ask them to
  paste it back into chat so you can continue from the chosen direction. The
  \`present-design-variants\` result's \`fallbackInstructions\` describe this.
- For direct refinements to an already chosen direction, call
  \`get-design-snapshot\`, edit from the current tuned HTML, then call
  \`generate-design\`.
- Use \`export-coding-handoff\` when the user wants to implement the chosen
  design in a codebase.

## Exploration Defaults

1. Default to three variants unless the user asks for a different count
   (\`present-design-variants\` accepts 2-5; three is the sweet spot).
2. Make variants structurally and stylistically distinct, not just color swaps.
3. Each variant must be a complete standalone HTML document that renders
   without a build step.
4. For product UI redesigns, prefer cleaner hierarchy, progressive disclosure,
   and realistic controls over decorative mockups.
5. After \`present-design-variants\`, wait for the user's pick before
   generating the next version. If they say "I like #2 but...", snapshot the
   chosen design and refine that direction with \`generate-design\`.

## Cross-App Use

- Hosted default: connect \`https://design.agent-native.com/_agent-native/mcp\`.
  Do not put shared secrets in skill files.
- For CLI/code-editor clients, keep any \`npx @agent-native/core@latest connect\` command
  running until browser authorization finishes. Stopping it early can leave the
  browser approved but the local MCP config unwritten. Restart or reload the
  agent client after installing or connecting if Design tools do not appear in
  the live session.
- Dispatch can expose Design alongside other apps. Use Design for UI/UX design
  tasks, Assets for image/media selection, Slides for decks, and so on.
- Keep the loop visual: surface the inline MCP App or the returned "Open
  design" link instead of pasting large HTML blobs into chat.
- If a Design tool call returns \`Session terminated\`, \`needs auth\`, or
  another connector/session error, do not keep retrying the tool. Stop and give
  the user the reconnect step: in Claude Code run \`/mcp\` and choose
  Authenticate/Reconnect for the Design connector; from any terminal run
  \`npx -y @agent-native/core@latest reconnect https://design.agent-native.com\` — this
  re-authenticates WITHOUT reinstalling. Never reinstall from scratch just to fix
  auth. Continue once the connector is available.
- Do not hand-roll MCP HTTP requests with curl from the agent session. Use the
  host-exposed Design tools after restart/reload, or use the returned
  browser/deep-link fallback.
- If you inspect local MCP config, redact \`Authorization\`, \`http_headers\`,
  and token values. Never paste bearer tokens into chat or logs.

 */
const PLAN_SETUP_AUTH_MD = `## Setup & Authentication

There are two ways into Plans.

**Coding agent (CLI).** Install once with the Agent-Native CLI. The command
installs the Plans skills, registers the hosted Plans MCP connector, and runs
auth/setup for the selected local client(s) in the same step (a one-time browser
sign-in at setup — this is intended), so the first tool call in that client does
not hit an OAuth wall:

\`\`\`bash
npx @agent-native/core@latest skills add visual-plan
\`\`\`

After that, \`/visual-plan\` and \`/visual-recap\` are the two installed slash
commands. The other planning modes (\`create-ui-plan\`, \`create-prototype-plan\`,
\`create-plan-design\`, \`create-visual-questions\`) are MCP tools reachable from
\`/visual-plan\`, not separate slash commands. Pass \`--no-connect\` to register
the connector without authenticating, then run
\`npx @agent-native/core@latest connect https://plan.agent-native.com --client all\`
whenever you are ready, or choose a narrower \`--client\`. Auth and MCP tool
loading are per client config/session.

**Browser (people you share with).** Open the Plans editor and create & edit
with no sign-up — you work as a guest. Sign in only when you want to save or
share; signing in claims the plans you made as a guest into your account.

Sharing and commenting require an account: public/shared plans are viewable by
anyone with the link, but commenting on them needs an agent-native account.

For fully offline, no-account use, run the Plans app locally and sync plans to
your repo as MDX. This local mode is a separate advanced path, not the default
hosted flow.

If a Plans tool returns \`needs auth\`, \`Unauthorized\`, or \`Session terminated\`,
do not keep retrying the tool. Stop and give the user the reconnect step for the
client they are using: Codex/Codex Desktop should run
\`npx -y @agent-native/core@latest reconnect https://plan.agent-native.com --client codex\`
and start a new Codex session; Claude Code should run \`/mcp\` and choose
Authenticate/Reconnect for the plan connector, or run the reconnect command with
\`--client claude-code\` and restart Claude. To refresh every local client config
that already has the Plan entry, use \`--client all\`, then restart/reload each
client. Reconnect re-authenticates WITHOUT reinstalling and finds the entry by
URL regardless of connector name. Never reinstall from scratch just to fix auth.
Continue once the connector is available.

const WIREFRAME_QUALITY_CORE = `<!-- SHARED-CORE:wireframe-quality START -->

**A wireframe is an HTML mockup. The renderer owns the look; you write the
content.** Set \`data.html\` to a self-contained, semantic HTML fragment of the
screen and set \`data.surface\`. The renderer owns the surface footprint/aspect,
the dark/light theme, the hand-drawn font, and the rough.js sketch overlay — you
never write \`<html>\`/\`<body>\`/\`<script>\`/\`<style>\` tags or any
width/height/coordinates. You write real HTML layout and real product
content; the renderer styles and roughens it.

**A wireframe block's data is an HTML screen plus a surface:**

\`\`\`json
{
  "surface": "browser",
  "html": "<div style=\\"display:flex;flex-direction:column;gap:10px;padding:16px;height:100%\\"><h1>Sign in</h1><p class=\\"wf-muted\\">Use your work email to continue.</p><div class=\\"wf-card\\" style=\\"display:flex;flex-direction:column;gap:10px\\"><label>Email<input value=\\"jane@acme.co\\" /></label><label>Password<input value=\\"••••••••\\" /></label><label style=\\"display:flex;align-items:center;gap:8px\\"><input type=\\"checkbox\\" checked /> Remember me</label><button class=\\"primary\\">Sign in</button></div><a href=\\"#\\">Forgot password?</a></div>"
}
\`\`\`

**Write PLAIN semantic HTML and let the renderer style it.** Bare elements
(\`h1\`/\`h2\`/\`h3\`, \`p\`, \`button\`, \`input\`, \`<input type="checkbox">\`, \`a\`, \`hr\`)
are auto-themed — no classes needed. Helper classes carry the rest:

- \`.wf-card\` / \`.wf-box\` — a bordered, padded container (a panel, a list item).
- \`.wf-pill\` / \`.wf-chip\` — a rounded tag or filter; add \`.accent\`
  (\`<span class="wf-pill accent">\`) for the accent-filled variant.
- \`.wf-muted\` — secondary/muted text (or use \`<small>\`).
- \`button.primary\` or any element with \`[data-primary]\` — the accent-filled
  primary button.

**Use the \`--wf-*\` tokens for any custom color, never hex.** The renderer flips
these on light/dark, so reading them is what keeps a mockup correct in both
themes. For any inline border, background, or text color, reference a token:
\`style="border:1.4px solid var(--wf-line)"\`. The tokens are \`--wf-ink\` (text),
\`--wf-muted\` (secondary text), \`--wf-line\` (borders/dividers), \`--wf-paper\`
(page background), \`--wf-card\` (raised surface), \`--wf-accent\` /
\`--wf-accent-fg\` / \`--wf-accent-soft\` (brand action), \`--wf-warn\`, \`--wf-ok\`,
and \`--wf-radius\`. Never hard-code a hex color and never set \`font-family\` — the
renderer owns the sketch/clean font.

**Lay out with inline \`style\` flex/grid.** You write the real layout —
\`display:flex; flex-direction:column; gap:10px; padding:16px\` and so on — and the
renderer never repositions anything. Compose the actual product: reproduce the
current screen, then show the modification. Real labels, real counts, real dates,
real button text grounded in the screen you read; not lorem or gray bars.

**Surface presets — match the real footprint, never default to desktop+mobile.**
Pick the \`surface\` that matches what the user will actually see:

- \`browser\`: a web page that needs a browser chrome frame around it.
- \`desktop\`: a full desktop app page or app shell.
- \`mobile\`: a phone screen, only when the work is genuinely mobile.
- \`popover\`: a small floating menu, dropdown, or inline popover.
- \`panel\`: a side panel, inspector, or sidebar widget.

A sidebar popover renders as a small surface, not a desktop page and a phone
frame. Do not emit \`desktop\` + \`mobile\` variants unless responsive behavior
actually changes the layout. For a component or widget, show one broader
app-context frame only when placement affects understanding, then the focused
component states.

**Model the actual component shell for small surfaces.** A rendered UI change
belongs in a wireframe; reserve \`diagram\` for architecture, dependency, state,
or data-flow relationships. Popovers, dropdown menus, command palettes, and
context menus use \`surface: "popover"\` unless the surrounding page placement is
the point of the change. Dialogs, sheets, inspectors, sidebars, and long
property panels use the matching \`panel\` / \`desktop\` surface as appropriate.
Show the real chrome: trigger or anchor when it matters, title/header row,
top-right actions, separators, fields, options, selected states, body content,
and footer actions that are visible in the workflow.

**Modify, don't redesign.** When the task changes an existing screen, reproduce
the current screen's real layout and footprint FIRST, then change only the delta
and call it out with a single annotation. Do not restack the page into a new
layout. For net-new surfaces, compose from the real app shell.

**Classify mockup scope before implementation.** Before turning a plan mockup
into source code, decide whether each artboard represents the whole page/app
shell, a route body inside an existing shell, or a component/sub-surface. If an
artboard includes navigation, sidebars, auth banners, or a signup/login form,
map those pieces to the real shared shell/auth components instead of nesting the
entire mockup inside the current page. When a mockup references the product's
standard signup/login page, find and reuse that existing implementation; do not
approximate it from the wireframe.

**Zoom in on sub-surfaces, don't redraw the page.** For a small sub-surface (a
popover, menu, dialog, toast), show the full screen once, then add a small
separate artboard whose \`html\` contains ONLY that sub-surface — do not re-draw
the whole page around it, and do not scale a duplicate up. Pick the matching
\`surface\` (e.g. \`popover\`) so the footprint is right; never widen a popover to
page width.

**Loading / skeleton states.** Set \`data.skeleton: true\` on the wireframe and
fill the \`html\` with neutral, textless placeholder geometry — boxes and bars
built as \`<div>\`s with \`background:var(--wf-line)\` and explicit heights/widths,
no labels or copy. The renderer drops borders, sketch, and color into the
skeleton register automatically. Never escape to a \`custom-html\` document block
to fake a loader.

**Editing an existing mockup.** To change one element, text, or color in an
existing html mockup, call \`update-visual-plan\`
with \`contentPatches: [{ op: "patch-wireframe-html", blockId, edits: [{ find,
replace }] }]\`. Each \`find\` is a unique snippet of the current html (read it
first with \`get-visual-plan\`); set \`all: true\` on an edit to replace every
occurrence. The result is re-sanitized.

**Treat the wireframe border as part of the visible design.** Always wrap HTML
wireframe content in a root container with real inner padding before drawing
cards, fields, pills, labels, or controls. Use at least 14-16px of padding,
\`box-sizing: border-box\`, \`height: 100%\`, and \`gap\` between child rows so the
first row never sits flush against the screen border. Keep text away from
borders: every container, field, button, menu item, and annotation needs enough
padding and line-height to read cleanly in the rendered Plan view.

**Lay out children safely so they never collide.** Use HTML flex/grid with
\`gap\`, \`min-width: 0\`, and sensible overflow. Avoid negative margins, absolute
positioning, or fixed child widths that can collide when the renderer switches
between light/dark, sketch/clean, or different zoom levels.

**Do not wrap intentionally single-line labels.** For toolbars, tab rails,
breadcrumbs, chip/filter rows, branch and file names, file chips, and code
filenames — any deliberately single-line row — do not let long text wrap. Put
\`white-space: nowrap\` on the row (and \`overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis\`
on the individual labels that can grow), so the wireframe demonstrates the actual
layout behavior instead of producing ugly stacked or vertical text. Use
horizontally scrollable or clipped rails for overflow.

**Fill the frame; keep labels short.** Each artboard is a fixed-size surface — compose enough realistic HTML to fill it top to bottom with even vertical rhythm; never leave a large empty band. On desktop/app-shell sidebars, let the nav stack flex to fill (\`flex:1\`) and add any persistent bottom action/status after it so the rail reads complete in taller frames. On mobile especially, flow real rows down the whole screen (status bar, header, then list/detail content) rather than a header floating above a gap. Keep every label short enough to sit on one line within its column — shorten the copy rather than relying on the frame to absorb it (long labels wrap or clip).

**Persistent chrome bars span the full frame width.** Top bars, app headers,
toolbars, and bottom tab/nav bars are full-width chrome, not centered content.
Lay each one out as a single flex row that fills the frame
(\`style="display:flex;align-items:center;width:100%"\`) and push trailing actions
to the right edge with a flex spacer (\`<div style="flex:1"></div>\`) between the
leading group and the trailing group — never center a bar inside a narrow,
centered block, and never let it collapse to the width of its contents. In a
Before/After pair the bar stays full-width in BOTH states even when one state has
fewer controls; the spacer absorbs the difference so the remaining controls hold
their edge alignment instead of sliding to the center.

**Pin bottom bars to the bottom of the frame.** For mobile tab bars, footers, and
any persistent bottom action row, make the frame itself a flex column at
\`height:100%\` (\`style="display:flex;flex-direction:column;height:100%"\`), give the
scrolling body \`flex:1\` so it absorbs the slack, and place the bar as the LAST
child of the frame (or set \`margin-top:auto\` on it). The bar then sits flush at
the bottom of the surface instead of floating directly under the content with an
empty band beneath it.

**Before / after must be comparable.** When showing a state change, preserve the
unchanged controls in both states so the reviewer can see exactly what moved or
appeared; do not show an added control as a generic box floating elsewhere in
the surface. Place the new/changed affordance where the implementation puts it —
for example, a new \`Edit with AI\` action in a popover header belongs in the
top-right header slot, aligned with the title, not in the body or footer. Use
the same frame size, scale, outer padding, border radius, and visual density on
both sides unless the change itself alters those properties, and let the frame
height fit the content rather than leaving a tall empty lower half.

**Name the states with the column header, never inside the frame.** For
document-body wireframes (recaps), put the two
states in a \`columns\` block and set each column's \`label\` to \`Before\` and
\`After\` — the renderer draws that label as an \`h4\` heading above each frame. Do
NOT bake a \`Before\`/\`After\` pill, title, or heading into the wireframe \`html\`: a
label placed inside reads as part of the product UI, lands in a random corner,
and clutters the comparison. The column header is the one and only place the
state name belongs. On a canvas, place the two state artboards as neighbors with
frame labels — never encode Before/After inside the html.

**Let the surface choose side-by-side vs. stacked.** For document-body
wireframes (recaps), the \`columns\` renderer lays
narrow surfaces (\`mobile\`, \`popover\`, \`panel\`) out side by side, and
automatically stacks wide surfaces (\`desktop\`, \`browser\`) vertically at full
document width so a large frame is never crushed into a half-width column and
cropped. Author both wireframes with the real \`surface\` and the matching
\`Before\`/\`After\` column labels; do not hand-stack the pair into separate
top-level wireframes or duplicate the state name as body content.

**Good example — a contacts list, surface \`browser\`.** A small, real screen
composed from the helper classes and tokens, layout in inline flex, no fonts or
hex colors:

\`\`\`html
<div
  style="display:flex;flex-direction:column;gap:12px;padding:16px;height:100%"
>
  <div style="display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content:space-between">
    <h1>Contacts</h1>
    <button class="primary">New contact</button>
  </div>
  <div style="display:flex;gap:6px">
    <span class="wf-pill accent">All 128</span>
    <span class="wf-pill">Favorites</span>
    <span class="wf-pill">Archived</span>
  </div>

// Canvas/artboard placement mechanics. Used only by visual-plan modes
// (visual-recap renders standalone wireframes, not a canvas).
const CANVAS_SURFACE_CORE = `<!-- SHARED-CORE:canvas-surface START -->

**The coordinate rule.** The \`surface\` locks each artboard's footprint and
aspect — never set artboard width/height and never use coordinates inside the
wireframe HTML; board-level artboard \`x\`/\`y\` IS allowed when it creates clear
lanes. Let canvas auto-placement handle simple one-row boards.

**Lay out mixed canvases in lanes.** When a canvas contains broad browser /
desktop frames plus compact \`mobile\`, \`popover\`, or \`panel\` surfaces, do not put
everything in one horizontal strip. Use board-level artboard \`x\`/\`y\` to reserve
lanes with generous empty space: main flow on one row, compact surfaces in their
own column or row, and loading/error states in a lower row. Keep at least 96px
between rendered artboard rectangles plus room for annotation gutters. Connect
only neighboring steps; never draw a long connector that skips across unrelated
frames. Before handoff, inspect the top canvas at default zoom and move any
frame whose label, connector, or annotation crosses another frame.

**Canvas annotations are designer notes on the artboard.** When a top canvas is
present, sprinkle Figma-style notes near the frames they explain: a short
heading, supporting text, and bullets — plain text layers, never bordered or
shadowed cards, and never a box around a frame. The renderer spaces notes away
from frames, so place each note by the frame it describes. Use an arrow only to
point at one specific control or transition; for a broad frame-level note, write
text beside the frame with no connector. Connectors are for real sequences only —
never fake "Step 1 → Step 2" lines between independent states.

**Do not create overlapping annotations.** Anchor each ordinary note to the
frame it explains with \`targetId\` + \`placement\` (top/right/bottom/left), and
omit \`type\` or use \`type: "note"\`. The renderer parks notes in a gutter beside
the frame and lays them out automatically. Do not use \`type: "callout"\`,
\`type: "text"\`, \`type: "arrow"\`, x/y, or points for ordinary notes; those are
freeform review-markup layers and must be reserved for intentional markup in
open canvas space. Reserve arrows for a note that must point at one specific
control inside a frame; a note that simply sits beside its frame needs no arrow.

**Patching.** Edit one wireframe, canvas annotation, diagram, or block with targeted \`contentPatches\`
(for example \`patch-wireframe-html\`, \`patch-diagram-html\`, \`update-block\`,
\`replace-blocks\`, \`update-canvas-annotation\`) rather
than regenerating the whole plan. \`contentPatches\` are part of the public MCP
action schema, so Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and other hosts can make surgical
edits. If an agent is working from exported source files, use
\`read-visual-plan-source\` / \`patch-visual-plan-source\`: \`plan.mdx\` holds
frontmatter plus markdown/document blocks, \`canvas.mdx\` holds
\`<DesignBoard>/<Section>/<Artboard>/<Screen>/<Annotation>/<Connector>\`, and the
patch action normalizes the MDX back into the same JSON runtime model. JSON is
the canonical runtime shape; MDX is the repo-friendly authoring/export surface.
In the browser, humans edit \`rich-text\` prose inline; agents should still use
\`update-rich-text\` content patches or source patches for prose, and use
comments/structured patches for canvas, artboard, wireframe, and diagram edits.

**Never emit a titled artboard with no interior wireframe content.** Every artboard
you place on the canvas must carry an \`html\` wireframe or reference a wireframe
block via \`blockId\`; when using \`blockId\`, the referenced \`wireframe\` /
\`legacy-wireframe\` block must remain in the plan. If you remove a duplicate
wireframe from the document body, first move its \`data\` inline onto the
corresponding \`content.canvas.frames[*].wireframe\` / \`legacyWireframe\`. A
label-only frame or a frame pointing at a deleted block renders empty and is
rejected at parse time. If you only have a title, write it as a section header or
annotation, not an empty artboard.

**UI mockups belong in the top visual review area.** Static UI/product visuals
live on the canvas; multi-step UI flows get both canvas wireframes and a
prototype. When the user asks for a mockup, UI state, loading state, layout,
screen, or visual comparison, make the canvas the primary home for that static
visual. When the user asks for a prototype or the plan contains a sequence the
reviewer must feel, keep the canvas artboards and add \`content.prototype\` so the
top surface shows Wireframes / Prototype tabs. Architecture/code diagrams stay
inline in the document (the SKILL.md Visual Surface Choice section owns that
rule) unless the user explicitly asks for a spatial board. Document blocks
can explain, compare, or map implementation, but they should not host the
primary UI mockup or prototype just because \`custom-html\`, screenshots, or prose
are easier to produce. If the canvas/prototype surface cannot represent the
requested UI fidelity, still keep the closest top-surface representation and
call out or extend the needed renderer capability. A skeleton/loading mockup
also lives in a canvas artboard — never move a mockup out of the canvas.

**Legacy kit tree.** Older plans set a \`screen\` array of \`{ el, ...props }\` kit
nodes instead of \`html\`; the renderer still accepts and displays it, but new
plans emit \`html\`. Do not author fresh kit-tree screens - write the HTML mockup
instead. Likewise, old or imported plans may carry coordinate-based regions or
free-float x/y on notes; those are legacy escape hatches the renderer still
shows but you must never produce. The gutter parks notes by \`targetId\` +
\`placement\`, and the coordinate rule at the top of this file governs all
new-plan placement.

<!-- SHARED-CORE:canvas-surface END -->`;

const DOCUMENT_QUALITY_CORE = `<!-- SHARED-CORE:document-quality START -->

**The document is a serious technical plan, not marketing.** Write it the way a
strong Claude or Codex implementation plan reads: outcome-first, prose-first,
self-contained, and specific. State the objective and what "done" means, the
scope and non-goals, the proposed approach with the key decisions and their
rationale, ordered steps that name real files, symbols, actions, and data
shapes, the risks, and a closing verification step (tests, build, or a checkable
behavior). Replace vague prose with specifics; never ship a step like "make it
work." No hero art, gradients, logos, nav bars, slogans, value props, giant
landing-page headings, or marketing cards unless the user explicitly asks.

**When top visuals exist, they and the document never duplicate each other.**
For UI work, the UI story lives in the top visual surface: canvas artboards for
static inspection, plus prototype tabs when the flow should be functional. The
document carries the technical depth the visuals cannot show — concrete
file/symbol maps, API and data contracts, code snippets, migration or
implementation phases, risks, and validation. For architecture/code reviews,
invert that: the document is the visual surface, and each recommendation
carries its own nearby inline \`diagram\` / \`data-model\` block plus file
evidence (the \`diagram\` bullet below owns how to author those diagrams).
Repeat a wireframe in the document only for a genuinely new detail view or
comparison. Skip the visual surface entirely for non-visual work and write a
clean rich document. For a simple binary UI visual choice, show the two
directions in the canvas only; do not repeat the same options as body
wireframes or prose. Put the actual choice in the bottom "Open Questions" form.

**Use the right block, and make it carry substance.** For the authoritative,
machine-checked list of block types and their data schemas, call \`get-plan-blocks\`
— it returns the live registry vocabulary (type, MDX tag, placement, key fields)
so you never emit a block the editor cannot render or round-trip:

- \`rich-text\` for plan prose with real bold/italic/code/links and nested lists.
- \`annotated-code\` for the file map: when a load-bearing file is worth
  highlighting, prefer the annotated walkthrough over a bare \`code\` block — carry
  the real, syntax-highlighted code AND anchor short margin notes to the lines
  that actually change (the new action, the changed schema, the wiring point), so
  the reader sees what matters and why instead of code for code's sake. Each
  annotation is \`{ lines: "12" | "12-18"; label?; note }\`; keep a few high-signal
  notes per file, not one per line. Highlight only the files worth reading; never
  an exhaustive list of every touched file, and never a prose-only description of
  a file. Drop to a plain \`code\` block only for a throwaway snippet with nothing
  to call out. When more than one file matters, group the blocks in a vertical
  \`tabs\` block (the standard tab primitive) rather than a bespoke container. If
  the exact code is unknown, show the smallest plausible planned shape or a
  commented stub naming what to fill in. (\`code-tabs\` and \`implementation-map\`
  are legacy: their renderers stay for old plans, but do not author new ones.)
- For a decision: if the reviewer must still pick between a genuinely-open
  either/or, put it in the bottom Open Questions \`question-form\` as a \`single\`
  question — one option per real alternative, each with a short detail and
  \`recommended: true\` on the one you would choose; do not also restate the same
  choice elsewhere. If you have already committed to an approach, state it as
  settled prose or a \`callout\` with \`tone="decision"\`, optionally with a
  \`columns\` block for a side-by-side comparison of the options you weighed — not
  as a confusing mid-document form for a question you have already answered.
- \`columns\` for side-by-side before/after or current/target comparisons where
  each side needs real nested blocks; label the columns clearly and avoid
  stacking comparison blocks vertically when parallel reading is the point.
- \`diagram\` for two-dimensional architecture, dependency, data-flow, or state
  relationships, only when it clarifies something real. Prefer standard
  two-dimensional layouts — paired before/after panels, layered diagrams,
  swimlanes, dependency maps, matrices, or grouped regions; do not default to
  left-to-right chains, and use a line only when the relationship is truly a
  sequence. For architecture/code
  diagrams, prefer \`data.html\` / \`data.css\` with semantic HTML and inline SVG so
  the diagram can use panels, layers, matrices, arrows, annotations, and
  responsive layout directly. Author diagram HTML with renderer-owned primitives
  like \`.diagram-panel\`, \`.diagram-card\`, \`.diagram-node\`, \`.diagram-box\`,
  \`.diagram-pill\`, \`.diagram-muted\`, and \`[data-rough]\`; they map to the plan's
  Tailwind theme variables through \`--wf-ink\`, \`--wf-muted\`, \`--wf-line\`,
  \`--wf-paper\`, \`--wf-card\`, \`--wf-accent\`, \`--wf-accent-soft\`, \`--wf-warn\`, and
  \`--wf-ok\`, and switch to Excalifont plus rough.js outlines in sketchy mode. Do not
  set \`font-family\` and do not hard-code hex, rgb, or hsl colors in diagram HTML
  or CSS. Leave room for the sketch font: keep labels short, give nodes generous
  width, and place boundary/annotation labels in unused space instead of over
  nodes; labels must not overlap nodes, connectors, or each other. For small
  text/SVG changes to an existing HTML diagram, use \`patch-diagram-html\` with a
  unique \`find\`/\`replace\` snippet instead of resending the whole \`data.html\`
  string. Use legacy \`nodes\` / \`edges\` only for small previews or truly
  sequential flows. In architecture/code plans, prefer a repeated section rhythm:
  recommendation title, confidence and category badges, code-path evidence, a
  local before/after or current/target spatial diagram, then concise
  Problem/Solution/Why text.
- \`tabs\` for multiple states, directions, or comparisons. A tab that reveals
  only prose usually means the plan is under-specified — include a relevant
  visual unless the tab is intentionally document-only.
- \`table\`, \`checklist\`, \`callout\` for scannable structure.

**Open questions live at the bottom as a form when answers would change the
plan.** Surface answerable unresolved decisions in a final \`question-form\`
block titled "Open Questions" so the renderer presents it as a distinct section.
That bottom form is the ONLY place that enumerates the open questions: never add
a second "Open Questions" heading, list, or recap of the same questions earlier
in the document. A one-line pointer in the overview prose ("a few decisions are
still open — see Open Questions below") is fine, but do not reproduce the
question list or a parallel questions/decisions section above it.
Use \`single\` or \`multi\` for clear choices, \`freeform\` for constraints,
\`recommended: true\` for the default you would pick, and option \`wireframe\` /
\`diagram\` previews only when the options are not already visible in the top
canvas. \`single\` and \`multi\` questions always render a write-in field so a
reviewer can answer with a custom option — never add an explicit "Other" option
yourself; set \`allowOther: false\` only when a free-text answer makes no sense.
Keep non-answerable assumptions or risks as concise \`callout\` blocks in
the relevant section. Never bury a questions/decisions wall inside the plan
narrative, and never ask the same question twice.

**\`custom-html\` is a bounded escape hatch only** — a single complete fragment
inside a block, never \`html\`/\`head\`/\`body\`/\`script\` tags, never a generic
placeholder, density demo, or proof that custom HTML works. Prefer the native
blocks for normal plans. For architecture/code reviews, use \`diagram\`
\`data.html\` / \`data.css\` for rich local HTML/SVG diagrams instead of
\`custom-html\`. For UI/product work, \`custom-html\` is never the primary home for a
requested mockup, UI state, or visual comparison. If UI fidelity requires
HTML/CSS, image capture, or real React/CSS, the product fix is canvas support
for that artifact type, not moving the mockup into the document.

**Before handoff, open the plan and check it.** Fix overlap, excessive
whitespace, clipped fragments, misleading inactive controls, poor contrast, and
unreadable diagrams before asking for approval.

<!-- SHARED-CORE:document-quality END -->`;

const EXEMPLAR_CORE = `<!-- SHARED-CORE:exemplar START -->

**GOOD.** A UI-first plan for a todo app: a canvas with a \`desktop\` artboard whose
\`data.html\` is a real flex layout — a sidebar of links (\`Inbox 12\`, \`Today 4\`,
\`Done\`), a main column with an \`<h1>Today</h1>\`, accent \`.wf-pill\`s for the
filters, a muted section label \`OVERDUE\`, and \`.wf-card\` task rows carrying real
titles, due dates, and a primary \`button.primary\` — styled only through bare
elements, helper classes, and \`--wf-*\` tokens, so the renderer applies the
correct desktop footprint, theme, and one subtle whole-frame wobble. Plain-text
designer notes sit spaced off the frame, pointing only at the controls that need
explanation. Below it, a Claude/Codex-grade document: objective and
done-criteria, a few \`code\` blocks (grouped in a vertical \`tabs\` block when
more than one) showing the real shape of the load-bearing files, a \`callout\`
with \`tone="decision"\` stating the chosen approach with a \`columns\` block
weighing the two real options behind it,
and a validation step — none of it repeating the canvas. If the task also
changes a multi-step completion flow, the same top area includes a Prototype tab
whose screens use the same labels and states as the canvas artboards, with
\`data-goto\` controls for the sequence. This is the bar.

**GOOD.** A \`/visual-plan\` for a backend architecture review: no top canvas.
The document opens with context and a legend, then repeats recommendation cards:
title, confidence/category badges, a monospace grid of real file paths, one
inline two-dimensional before/after or layered architecture diagram, and terse
Problem/Solution/Why bullets using the codebase's vocabulary. The diagram uses
space to show boundaries, layers, and ownership; it is not a default
left-to-right chain. The plan ends with a top recommendation and a bottom
question-form only if the next architecture direction is genuinely open. This is
better than a top canvas because each diagram is local to the claim it supports.

**BAD.** A \`data.html\` with hard-coded hex colors, a \`font-family\`, or fixed
pixel width/height; gray placeholder bars "insinuating" text on a non-skeleton
frame; a forced desktop + mobile pair for a popover; floating bordered
annotation cards hugging the frames; a fresh hand-authored kit-tree \`screen\`
instead of \`html\`; a multi-step UI flow with only static frames and no prototype
tab; a mockup escaped into a document \`custom-html\` block; and a marketing-style
document with a hero heading and value props that just restates what the canvas
already shows. Also bad: an architecture-only plan forced into a top canvas of
labeled boxes with overlapping text, where the actual code evidence and
recommendations live elsewhere. Never produce this.

# Agent-Native Plans

Agent-Native Plans is structured visual planning mode for coding agents. Build
the plan you would normally write in Markdown, but as a scannable document with
editable blocks mixed in: inline diagrams, code snippets,
open questions, and an optional top visual review area (wireframe canvas, live
prototype, or both in tabs). Architecture and backend plans stay document-only;
UI and product plans start with the top canvas/prototype (the Visual Surface
Choice section owns that rule).

\`/visual-plan\` is the packaged command and main entry point. Choose the review
mode from the task: UI-first when the work is primarily product UI and review
should start with screens, prototype-first when review should start with a
functional live prototype, design-first when review needs full-fidelity branded
screens, or visual-intake when the user explicitly wants a questionnaire before
planning. When a Codex, Claude Code, Markdown, or pasted plan already exists,
\`/visual-plan\` uses that source plan as the starting point and builds the review
surface from it instead of starting over.

## When To Use

Create or adapt a visual plan when work is multi-file, ambiguous, long-running,
risky, or UI-heavy, when architecture / data flow / UI direction / options /
open questions would benefit from inline diagrams or structured blocks, when the
user needs to react to a direction before you implement, or when an existing text
plan needs a richer review surface.

## Plan Discipline

- **Gate hard.** A polished visual plan is the most expensive plan form; only
  invest when a wrong direction is costly. Skip it for trivial, unambiguous work
  — typos, one-line fixes, a single well-specified function, anything whose diff
  you could describe in one sentence — and just make the change. Never pad a plan
  with filler and never ship a single-step plan.
- **Research before you draft.** Read the real files, actions, schema, and
  patterns first; name actual files, symbols, and data shapes instead of
  inventing them. Check existing \`actions/\` before proposing endpoints and prefer
  named client helpers over raw fetch. Delegate wide exploration to a sub-agent.
  Lead with reuse: for each step, name what it reuses — existing actions, schema,
  components, helpers — before what it adds, so the plan explains the genuinely new
  delta instead of redescribing what already exists.
- **Decide the hard-to-reverse bets first.** For non-trivial backend, data, or API
  work, sketch where the feature is headed, then call out the decisions that are
  expensive to undo once data or callers depend on them — wire format, public ids,
  data-model shape, auth and ownership boundaries — and get those right in the plan
  even if most of the feature ships later. Then scope to the smallest first cut that
  proves the approach without foreclosing it, stating both what is in and what is
  explicitly deferred.
- **Preserve existing plans.** If the user pasted, referenced, or already has a
  Codex / Claude Code / Markdown plan, treat it as source material. Preserve its
  intent, do not invent codebase facts, label inferred visuals as inferred, and
  build the visual review structure around the plan the user already has.
- **Planning is read-only.** Make no source edits while building or reviewing the
  plan. Start editing only after the user approves the direction.
- **Clarify vs. assume.** Do not ask how to build it — explore and present the
  approach and options in the plan. Ask a clarifying question only when an
  ambiguity would change the design and you cannot resolve it from the code; use
  the host agent's normal ask-user-question flow and batch 2-4 high-leverage
  questions before finalizing. Do not call \`create-visual-questions\` from
  \`/visual-plan\`. Otherwise state the assumption explicitly and proceed, and
  keep anything unresolved in the plan's single bottom \`question-form\` Open
  Questions block.
- **The plan is the approval gate.** After surfacing it, ask the user to review
  and approve before you write code, and name which files/areas the work touches.
  Presenting the plan and requesting sign-off is the approval step — do not ask a
  separate "does this look good?" question.
- **The document is the source of truth, not the chat.** When scope shifts,
  update the plan with \`update-visual-plan\` rather than only changing course in
  chat, and re-read the approved plan before major steps.

## Always Publish As An Agent-Native Plan — Never Inline

The deliverable is ALWAYS a published Agent-Native Plan created via the Plan
MCP connector (\`plan\` server, or legacy \`agent-native-plans\`). NEVER hand the
plan over as inline chat content — no Markdown prose, ASCII sketch, table, or
fenced wireframe. If the connector's tools are missing, do NOT fall back to
inline output: the usual cause is a connector that did not finish connecting
this session (it registers zero tools), not auth. Stop and give the user the
exact restore step for their current client: in Codex/Codex Desktop run
\`npx -y @agent-native/core@latest reconnect https://plan.agent-native.com --client codex\`
and start a new Codex session; in Claude Code run \`/mcp\` and choose
Authenticate/Reconnect (or run the same reconnect command with
\`--client claude-code\` and restart Claude). Auth is stored per client
config/session, so one client's reconnect does not make another running client
load tools. Never reinstall from scratch just to fix auth. Publish once the tool
is reachable. Local-files privacy mode (after Tool Guidance) is the only
exception.

## Core Workflow

1. Follow the host agent's normal planning flow: inspect the codebase, delegate
   wide exploration when useful, gather the info needed, and ask native
   clarifying questions as needed before generating the plan. If a source plan
   already exists, gather its exact text from the user's paste, a referenced
   file, or recent visible agent context; do not invent source text.
2. Call \`get-plan-blocks\` for the authoritative block catalog — do not author
   from memorized tags. Then call the mode-matched create tool:
   \`create-visual-plan\` for document-first plans (architecture, backend, data,
   refactor, API), \`create-ui-plan\` for UI-first plans, \`create-prototype-plan\`
   for prototype-first plans, \`create-plan-design\` for design-first plans,
   \`create-visual-questions\` only when the user explicitly asks for a visual
   intake questionnaire. When a source plan already exists,
   pass it as \`planText\` and preserve the original plan's intent while adding
   structured review content.
3. Compose or enrich any top UI/product visual surface and write the document
   with native blocks (see \`references/canvas.md\` and
   \`references/document-quality.md\`). Keep the document close to the Markdown
   plan the agent would normally output, or to the existing plan when one was
   provided. For non-visual plans, skip the top visual surface (Visual Surface
   Choice below owns the rule) and put \`diagram\`, \`data-model\`,
   \`api-endpoint\`, \`diff\`, \`file-tree\`, \`code\`, and \`annotated-code\` blocks
   directly next to the relevant prose.
4. Surface the returned Plans link or inline MCP App and ask the user to review.
   Always include the actual URL in chat so the next step is a click in CLI or
   other text-only hosts. When the host exposes an embedded browser/preview panel
   and a tool can open arbitrary URLs there, open the returned plan URL
   automatically for convenient review — a convenience and smoke test, never the
   only handoff or the access
   model. Plans should load out of the box for the local agent and local browser
   session; if a signed-in embedded browser cannot read a local plan that an
   anonymous/tool check can read, fix the app/action ownership or access path
   rather than patching one plan by hand. For high-stakes plans (architecture,
   backend, data, multi-file, or risky), also kick off the self-review pass in
   **Self-Review Before Handoff** while the user reads, instead of blocking the
   handoff on it.
5. Call \`get-plan-feedback\` before editing, after review, after any long pause,
   and before the final response. Treat \`anchorDetails\`, resolver intent, recent
   review events, and any focused screenshots from browser handoff as the source
   of truth for exactly what changed and exactly what each comment points at.
6. Apply changes with \`update-visual-plan\`, preferring targeted \`contentPatches\`.
   When the user wants source-control friendly edits, use
   \`patch-visual-plan-source\` against the MDX files instead of regenerating the
   plan.
7. Export with \`export-visual-plan\` only when the user wants a shareable receipt
   or repo-check-in artifacts.

## Self-Review Before Handoff

For high-stakes plans — architecture, backend, data-model, migration, multi-file,
or otherwise risky work — run one adversarial self-review pass before treating the
plan as final. Skip it for small, UI-only, or single-decision plans where the cost
outweighs the value. Keep the pass cheap and non-blocking:

- **Surface the plan first, review concurrently.** Post the link and let the user
  start reading, then run the review in parallel — never make the user wait on it.
- **Review the written plan; do not re-research.** Critique the plan text and its
  own blocks. The grounding was already done while drafting, so the review checks
  the output instead of re-exploring the repo.
- **Spawn one skeptical reviewer** whose only job is to find what is weak, missing,
  or wrong — not to praise. Point it at: hard-to-reverse decisions made implicitly
  or not at all (wire format, public ids, data-model shape, auth, ownership); steps
  not anchored in real files or symbols; a menu of options where the plan should
  commit to one; obvious missing decisions ("what happens when X?", "why not Y?");
  and padding or single-step filler.
- **Fix vs. ask.** Apply clear-cut fixes yourself with \`update-visual-plan\`
  \`contentPatches\` — vague non-goals, unanchored claims, an obvious missing
  decision. Route genuine judgment calls back to the user instead: add them to the
  bottom \`question-form\` Open Questions block or batch them into the normal
  ask-user-question flow. Do not silently decide them.
- **Do not surprise the user mid-read.** On a large plan, apply the patches before
  the editor loads; otherwise note briefly that a self-review is running so the
  plan changing under them is expected. When you next respond, summarize what the
  review changed and what it surfaced for the user to decide.

## Visual Surface Choice

Choose the surface before creating the plan or after reading the source plan. Do
not add visual chrome by default:

- **No visual surface** for architecture-only, backend-only, data migration,
  copy-only, or otherwise non-visual plans. Do not use the top canvas for
  architecture diagrams, dependency maps, file plans, API contracts, or
  data-flow-only reviews. Use a strong document with local inline diagrams
  only when relationships need a visual explanation, usually one spatial diagram
  per recommendation or decision. Prefer grouped regions, layers, quadrants,
  matrices, or before/after panels over a single-axis chain unless the
  relationship is truly sequential.
- **Canvas only** for one static screen, a before/after comparison, a component
  state, a small popover, or a visual direction that does not require clicking.
  Put those wireframes in \`content.canvas\` and omit \`content.prototype\`.
- **Canvas + prototype** for multi-step UI flows, onboarding, wizards,
  review/approval flows, navigation changes, or anything where the reviewer
  needs to operate the behavior. Keep the static wireframes in
  \`content.canvas\`, add the aligned functional prototype in
  \`content.prototype\`, and rely on the top visual tabs to switch between them.
- **Prototype-first** when the user asks to operate the UI or when interaction is
  the main question. Use \`create-prototype-plan\`, which still preserves static
  mocks where useful.

For mixed canvas + prototype plans, reuse the same real labels, app statuses,
and screen ids across both surfaces. The canvas is the inspectable static reference;
the prototype is the interactive version of that same flow, not a separate
design direction.

## Tool Guidance

- \`create-visual-plan\`: start one structured visual plan per agent task/run, or
  import an existing text plan by passing \`planText\`; \`content\` may include no
  visual surface, canvas only, or canvas + prototype.
- \`create-ui-plan\`: start a UI-first plan when the work is primarily product UI.
- \`create-prototype-plan\`: start a prototype-first plan with a functional top
  review surface.
- \`create-plan-design\`: start a full-fidelity branded Design-tab plan with an
  optional matching Prototype tab.
- \`convert-visual-plan-to-prototype\`: convert an existing HTML wireframe canvas
  into a prototype plan.
- \`create-visual-questions\`: use only when the user explicitly asks for a visual
  intake questionnaire, not as \`/visual-plan\` preflight.
- \`update-visual-plan\`: revise content, status, or comments with targeted
  \`contentPatches\` (see Core Workflow step 6).
- \`read-visual-plan-source\`: read the normalized plan as \`plan.mdx\`,
  optional \`canvas.mdx\`, optional \`.plan-state.json\`, and JSON.
- \`patch-visual-plan-source\`: apply granular MDX AST patches by stable block,
  artboard, annotation, component, or wireframe-node id.
- \`import-visual-plan-source\`: create or replace a plan from an MDX folder.
- \`get-visual-plan\`: read the current structured plan, exported HTML, and
  annotations; it also returns the MDX folder for source workflows.
- \`get-plan-feedback\`: read unconsumed human feedback. Use it frequently; it
  returns grouped threads, exact anchor details, expected resolver, and recent
  review-event payloads so agents can act only on the comments meant for them.
- \`get-plan-blocks\`: resolve block tags before authoring — do not memorize tags;
  call this first to get the authoritative tag names, required fields, and prop
  shapes from the live block registry.
- \`export-visual-plan\`: export HTML, Markdown fallback, structured JSON, and MDX
  files for repo check-in.

When the user critiques a plan's look or structure, fix the renderer or this
skill — never hand-edit one stored plan. Turn feedback into better guidance.

## Local-Files Privacy Mode

Use local-files privacy mode when the user explicitly asks for no DB writes,
no hosted Plan app, no Plan MCP publish, fully local files, offline/private
planning, or when \`AGENT_NATIVE_PLANS_MODE=local-files\` is set. In this mode the
plan data must never be sent to the Plan MCP server or Plan app action surface.

The local-files contract is:

- Read source context from local files and shell commands only.
- Write the plan as a local MDX folder under \`plans/<slug>/\`: \`plan.mdx\`,
  optional \`canvas.mdx\`, optional \`prototype.mdx\`, and optional
  \`.plan-state.json\`.
- Run \`npx @agent-native/core@latest plan local preview --dir plans/<slug> --kind plan\` after
  writing or updating the folder. Report the returned local URL or the
  \`/local-plans/<slug>\` route if the local Plan app is running with the same
  \`PLAN_LOCAL_DIR\`.
- Do **not** call \`create-visual-plan\`, \`create-ui-plan\`,
  \`create-prototype-plan\`, \`create-plan-design\`, \`import-visual-plan-source\`,
  \`update-visual-plan\`, \`patch-visual-plan-source\`, \`get-plan-feedback\`,
  \`export-visual-plan\`, or any hosted Plan tool for that plan.
- Treat feedback as file or chat feedback: update the MDX files directly, rerun
  the local preview command, and summarize the new local URL/path. Hosted
  comments, sharing, history, and publish/export receipts are unavailable until
  the user explicitly opts into publishing.

Local-files mode prevents plan content from going to the Agent-Native Plan
database. It does not by itself make the coding agent's language model local;
for that stronger privacy boundary, the host agent/model must also be local or
otherwise approved by the user.

## Interpreting comment anchors

\`get-plan-feedback\` returns rich anchors — read them before acting on any comment.

- **Coordinate frames.** \`targetX\`/\`targetY\` are percentages *within* the
  element named by \`targetSelector\`/\`targetKind\`. Bare \`x\`/\`y\` are percentages
  of the whole plan document. \`canvasX\`/\`canvasY\` are raw board-world pixels on
  the design canvas (board size given when available).
- **Wireframe pins.** Anchors on wireframes include \`targetNodeId\` and
  \`targetNodePath\` (e.g. \`card > list > listItem "Acme Inc"\`) identifying the
  exact kit node. Use \`targetNodeId\` directly with wireframe node patch ops;
  use \`data-design-id\` values from design artboards with
  \`update-design-element-style\`. Prefer the node id/path over raw coordinates;
  fall back to coordinates plus the focused screenshot (red ring marks the exact
  point) only when no node id is present.
- **Text quotes.** Resolve \`textQuote\` against current prose using
  \`contextBefore\`/\`contextAfter\` for disambiguation. If \`ambiguous: true\`, ask
  the user — do not guess which occurrence is meant.
- **Detached comments.** \`get-plan-feedback\` flags threads whose quoted text no
  longer exists as \`detached\` (in \`detachedThreads\`). Reconcile these against
  rewritten content — never silently drop them.
- **Routing.** \`resolutionTarget\` is the only routing signal: act on \`agent\`,
  treat \`human\` as context only. \`@mentions\` are people to notify, never a
  routing signal.
- **Two-axis state.** Mark every ingested comment as consumed
  (\`consumedCommentIds\` on \`update-visual-plan\`). Set \`status=resolved\` only on
  agent-targeted comments you actually addressed; leave human-targeted comments
  open.

## Visibility & Sharing

Use \`set-resource-visibility\` to change who can see a plan (e.g. public, login,
or org-scoped). Use \`share-resource\` to grant specific users or roles access
by email or role. Gate visibility before sharing any plan that covers
unreleased or private work — default to the narrowest scope that meets the
review need.

# Visual Recap

\`/visual-recap\` creates a visual plan built **from** a diff, not toward one. It
is the reverse of forward planning: instead of describing the change you are
about to make, you describe the change that was just made, at a higher altitude
than line-by-line review. The same plan data model serves both directions —
schema, API, file, and architecture changes become the same \`data-model\`,
\`api-endpoint\`, \`file-tree\`, and \`diagram\` blocks a forward plan would use, only
now they summarize work that exists. A reviewer scans the shape of the change
before spending attention on the literal lines.

## Local-Files Privacy Mode Exception

Use local-files privacy mode when the user explicitly asks for no DB writes,
no hosted Plan app, no Plan MCP publish, fully local files, offline/private
recaps, or when \`AGENT_NATIVE_PLANS_MODE=local-files\` is set. This is the only
exception to the hosted publish rule below.

In local-files mode:

- Read the diff/stat/source context from local files and shell commands only.
  The existing \`npx @agent-native/core@latest recap collect-diff\`, \`scan\`, and
  \`build-prompt --local-files\` helpers are safe to use because they operate on
  local files and do not write to the Plan database.
- Write the recap as a local MDX folder under \`plans/<slug>/\`: \`plan.mdx\`,
  optional \`canvas.mdx\`, optional \`prototype.mdx\`, and optional
  \`.plan-state.json\`. Set \`kind: "recap"\` and \`localOnly: true\` in
  frontmatter/state when authoring the source.
- Run \`npx @agent-native/core@latest plan local preview --dir plans/<slug> --kind recap\` after
  writing or updating the folder. Report the returned local URL or the
  \`/local-plans/<slug>\` route if the local Plan app is running with the same
  \`PLAN_LOCAL_DIR\`.
- Do **not** call \`create-visual-recap\`, \`create-visual-plan\`,
  \`import-visual-plan-source\`, \`update-visual-plan\`,
  \`patch-visual-plan-source\`, \`get-plan-feedback\`, \`export-visual-plan\`,
  \`set-resource-visibility\`, or any hosted Plan tool for that recap.
- Treat review feedback as file or chat feedback: update the MDX files directly,
  rerun the local preview command, and summarize the new local URL/path.
  Hosted comments, sharing, screenshots, usage attachment, and PR sticky comment
  publishing are unavailable until the user explicitly opts into publishing.

Local-files mode prevents recap content from going to the Agent-Native Plan
database. It does not by itself make the coding agent's language model local;
for that stronger privacy boundary, the host agent/model must also be local or
otherwise approved by the user.

## Always Publish As An Agent-Native Plan — Never Inline

The deliverable is ALWAYS a published Agent-Native Plan, created with the
\`create-visual-recap\` tool on the Plan MCP connector. The connector is usually
exposed as the \`plan\` server, but older installed agents may expose the same
hosted connector as \`agent-native-plans\`; both names are valid. NEVER hand the
recap to the user as inline chat content — not Markdown prose, not an ASCII
sketch, not a table, not a fenced "wireframe", not a "here's the recap" summary.
A recap's entire value is the hosted, interactive, annotatable plan; an inline
summary is not a recap, it is the thing a recap replaces. The only supported
output is to publish the plan and return its absolute URL.

Except for the explicit local-files privacy mode above, if neither the \`plan\`
nor legacy \`agent-native-plans\` Plan MCP tools are available, do NOT improvise an
inline recap as a fallback. Do not report the connector as disconnected just
because it is named \`agent-native-plans\` instead of \`plan\`. The usual cause is a
connector that did not finish connecting this session (it registers zero tools),
NOT necessarily an auth problem — so do not assume the user must authenticate.
Stop and tell the user how to restore it for their current client: in
Codex/Codex Desktop, run
\`npx -y @agent-native/core@latest reconnect https://plan.agent-native.com --client codex\`
and start a new Codex session; in Claude Code, run \`/mcp\` and choose
Authenticate/Reconnect, or run the reconnect command with \`--client claude-code\`
and restart Claude. Auth is stored per client config/session; \`--client all\`
refreshes every local client config that already has the Plan entry, but each
running client still has to reload its MCP tools. Reconnect re-authenticates
WITHOUT reinstalling and finds the entry by URL regardless of connector name.
Never reinstall from scratch just to fix auth. Then publish once the tool is
reachable. Falling back to inline content is a defect, not a degraded mode.

## When To Use

Build a recap when a PR or commit is large, multi-file, or touches schema, API
contracts, or architecture, and a reviewer would benefit from seeing the change
mapped to structured blocks before reading the raw diff. A GitHub Action can
generate one automatically from a PR diff; an agent can generate one on request
("recap this PR", "show me what this branch changed"). Skip it for small,
single-file, or obvious diffs — a recap is review overhead, and a tiny change
reviews faster as plain diff.

## Recap The Whole Work Unit

When \`/visual-recap\` is invoked in a chat thread after work has already happened,
the default scope is the whole current work unit/thread, not only the most recent
user message, tool action, or follow-up fix. Gather the thread-owned changes
across the conversation: original implementation work, later bug fixes, UI
follow-ups, tests, changesets, skill/instruction updates, generated plan/source
artifacts, and any local import/linking fixes needed to make the recap open.

Use the current diff plus conversation context to separate thread-owned changes
from unrelated dirty work that existed before the thread. Exclude unrelated
pre-existing edits. If the scope is genuinely ambiguous and cannot be inferred,
state the assumption or ask a concise question before publishing.

When updating an existing recap after feedback, revise the recap so it still
covers the whole thread/work unit plus the new correction. Do not replace a broad
recap with a narrow recap of only the latest feedback unless the user explicitly
asks for that narrower scope.

## Keep The Recap Body Lean

Do not add boilerplate intro, disclaimer, provenance, or summary prose blocks to
the generated plan body. In particular, do not create a \`rich-text\` block just to
say the recap is an aid, that the reviewer should still review the diff, how many
files changed, or which ref/working tree generated the recap. The plan title,
brief, and \`file-tree\` (which carries the per-file change stats) already carry
that context.

Only add prose blocks when they tell the reviewer something specific about the
change that the structured blocks do not: the objective, a real compatibility
risk, an important decision visible in the diff, or a grounded review note.

## Recaps Must Be Substantial

Lean is not the same as thin. A recap is not a single wireframe plus one
sentence — that under-serves the reviewer as much as boilerplate prose over-serves
them. Alongside the visual/structural headline (wireframes, \`data-model\`,
\`api-endpoint\`, \`diagram\`), a substantial recap also carries the implementation
evidence:

- A short surface/state inventory before authoring: list the changed routes,
  components, popovers/dialogs, role/access states, empty/error states, and
  shared abstractions visible in the diff. The final recap must either represent
  each meaningful item with a block or intentionally omit it because it is tiny,
  redundant, or not user-visible.
- A \`file-tree\` of the changed files with each entry's \`change\` flag, so the
  reviewer sees the footprint of the work at a glance.
- The split \`diff\` of the KEY changed files, grouped under a \`## Key changes\`
  \`rich-text\` heading in a single horizontal \`tabs\` block (the default
  orientation, one file per tab), with a one-line \`summary\` and a few
  \`annotations\` on each — so the reviewer can drop from the high-altitude shape
  straight into the load-bearing code. Use horizontal file tabs, not a vertical
  side rail, so the selected file has enough width for the side-by-side diff.

Skip the diff appendix only for a genuinely tiny change that reviews faster as
plain diff (see "When To Use"); for any change worth recapping, the file-tree and
key-change diffs belong in the plan.

## Canonical Shape And Budgets

A strong recap follows one skeleton, top to bottom:

1. UI-impact headline — wireframes first, when the diff changed rendered UI.
2. Short outcome narrative (\`rich-text\`): what changed and why, 1-3 paragraphs.
3. \`data-model\` / \`api-endpoint\` blocks for schema and contract changes.
4. \`file-tree\` of the changed files with \`change\` flags.
5. \`## Key changes\` — one horizontal \`tabs\` block of \`diff\` / \`annotated-code\`.

Budgets that keep the recap reviewable:

- 3-8 key-change tabs. Fewer than 3 on a large change under-serves the
  reviewer; more than 8 stops being a summary.
- Keep each diff/annotated-code excerpt focused — prefer under ~150 lines per
  tab; summarize or link the rest of a long file instead of dumping it.
- Title at most ~70 characters; brief 1-3 sentences.

**GOOD.** A 25-file auth change: Before/After wireframes of the login surface,
a two-paragraph narrative, a diff-aware \`data-model\` of the sessions table, an
\`api-endpoint\` for the new refresh route, a \`file-tree\` with change flags, and
\`## Key changes\` with five focused tabs, each with a one-line \`summary\` and a
few annotations on the load-bearing hunks.

**BAD.** One giant unsegmented diff dump with no summaries or annotations; or a
sparse three-block recap of a 40-file change (one wireframe, one sentence, one
file list) that forces the reviewer back into the raw diff anyway.

## UI Impact Needs Wireframes

When the diff changes rendered UI, layout, density, visual state, interaction
affordances, navigation, controls, menus, dialogs, or design tokens, the recap
MUST include one or more wireframes. Prose and file diffs are not a substitute
for showing what changed visually.

Before choosing wireframes, make a UI coverage pass from the diff:

- Identify the entry surface where the change appears, such as a page header,
  list row, toolbar, route shell, or menu trigger.
- Identify the interaction surface that opens or changes, such as a popover,
  dialog, tab, sheet, dropdown, inline editor, or toast.
- Identify the resulting destination or persistent state, such as a public page,
  read-only view, empty state, error state, loading state, permission-denied
  state, or saved/shared state.
- Identify access or role variants when permissions change. Owner/admin/editor
  versus viewer/non-manager differences are visual behavior and need a compact
  matrix, paired wireframes, or clearly labeled state sequence.

For UI-heavy PRs, a single before/after of the entry surface is not enough.
Show the changed entry point, the main changed interaction surface, and the
resulting/destination state. Add more states when the diff adds tabs, role-based
controls, public/private visibility, invite/manage flows, destructive controls,
or empty/error branches.

Choose the smallest visual surface that makes the review clear:

- Use a \`Before\` / \`After\` wireframe pair when the reviewer benefits from direct
  comparison, such as a removed or added control, a changed state, layout
  density, ordering, navigation, or a visible component replacement.
  \`references/wireframe.md\` owns how to lay that pair out (columns vs.
  vertical stack by geometry).
- Use an after-only wireframe when the change is purely additive or the "before"
  state would only show absence without adding review value.
- Use more than two wireframes when the UI change is flow-dependent, responsive,
  or stateful; show the meaningful states in order instead of forcing a single
  before/after pair.
- For tiny surfaces like menus, popovers, dialogs, toasts, or panels, use the
  matching \`surface\` (\`popover\`, \`panel\`, etc.) and show the focused sub-surface.
  Do not redraw a full page unless placement in the page is itself part of the
  change.

Ground each wireframe in the changed UI behavior, component names, file paths,
and diff-visible labels/states. If exact pixels are inferred rather than
captured, say so in the wireframe caption or a concise annotation. For
local/manual recaps, import or update the plan source that holds the wireframes
so the rendered recap opens with the UI visual available.

## Wireframe Quality — read \`references/wireframe.md\`

UI recap/plan wireframes must meet a strict quality bar — full-width chrome,
pinned bottom bars, real product content, before/after comparability, the right
\`surface\` preset, \`--wf-*\` tokens instead of hex, and no \`<html>\`/\`<style>\`/font
tags. Before authoring ANY wireframe / \`<Screen>\` / \`WireframeBlock\`, READ
\`references/wireframe.md\` in this skill directory — it is the single source of
truth for HTML wireframe quality, shared word for word with \`/visual-plan\`
and \`/visual-recap\`. Do not author wireframes from memory.

Use the standard \`WireframeBlock\` / \`<Screen>\` format so the Plan viewer owns the
surface frame, theme, and sketchy/clean toggle. HTML wireframes are appropriate
when placement precision matters, especially popovers, menus, dialogs, and dense
forms. For HTML
wireframes, keep \`renderMode\` unset or \`wireframe\` unless a design-only editable
mockup is explicitly required, because \`renderMode="design"\` disables the
sketchy rough overlay.

When a browser tool is available, render a UI-impact recap in the Plan viewer
and visually inspect it at the current theme before sharing. If any label,
annotation, toolbar, or wireframe content overlaps another element, fix the MDX
and re-import before reporting the link. A text-match screenshot is not enough;
visually inspect the captured image. When no browser is available (for example
a headless CI agent), state that in the recap handoff instead.

## Open And Report The Recap

In local-files privacy mode, report the local preview URL/path from
\`npx @agent-native/core@latest plan local preview\` or the \`/local-plans/<slug>\` route for a local
Plan app using the same \`PLAN_LOCAL_DIR\`. Do not invent a hosted URL and do not
publish just to get an absolute Plan link.

After creating the recap, link the reviewer to the rendered plan with an
**absolute URL on the origin whose database actually holds the plan**. That
origin is the Plan MCP server you just created the recap through — NOT whatever
dev server you happen to know is running. The create tool returns the correct
link; report THAT. Never make the primary link a local \`plan.mdx\` file, a local
mirror folder, or a relative path such as \`/plans/<id>\`.

A recap lives only in the database of the MCP that created it. A separately
running local dev server (e.g. \`http://localhost:8081\`) has its OWN database and
will NOT contain a recap created through the hosted MCP, so a hand-built
\`localhost\` link returns "Plan not found". This is the most common recap
mistake — do not guess an origin you have not confirmed shares the MCP's data.

Resolve the URL in this order:

1. Use the absolute URL the create tool RETURNS — \`openLink.webUrl\`, else the
   \`visualUrl\` in the returned \`plan.mdx\` frontmatter, else \`url\`/\`path\`
   resolved against the MCP server's own origin (for the hosted MCP that is
   \`https://plan.agent-native.com\`). This always points at the database that has
   the plan.
2. Use a \`localhost\`/dev origin ONLY when the recap was created through a Plan
   MCP bound to that same origin — i.e. that MCP's url is
   \`http://localhost:<port>/_agent-native/mcp\`. Creating through the hosted MCP
   and linking to localhost is the exact mismatch that 404s.
3. If only a plan id is available, build the MCP origin's absolute URL
   (hosted: \`https://plan.agent-native.com/plans/<id>\`) and say it was inferred.

If the user wants to review on localhost but the recap was created through the
hosted MCP, say so plainly: the local dev server cannot see it. To view a recap
on localhost (e.g. to exercise un-deployed local renderer changes), they must
connect a LOCAL Plan MCP (\`http://localhost:<port>/_agent-native/mcp\`) and
re-create the recap through it so it lands in the local database; offer to do
that rather than handing over a localhost URL that will not resolve.

When running in Codex and the Browser/in-app side browser tools are available,
open the returned absolute recap URL there automatically after creation. Still
include the same absolute URL in the final response. Local mirror files like
\`plans/<slug>/plan.mdx\` may be mentioned only as secondary source-control
artifacts, not as the main way to open the recap.

## Diff → Block Mapping

Map each kind of change to the block that carries it, derived mechanically from
the actual diff. The names below are the CONCEPTUAL block types, not the JSX
tags — resolve every conceptual name to its exact tag + prop schema with the
\`get-plan-blocks\` tool (see "Block reference" below) before authoring.

- **Schema / migration change** → \`data-model\` for the resulting entities,
  fields, and relations. Flag what moved per field/entity with
  \`change: "added" | "modified" | "removed" | "renamed"\`, and for a changed type
  set \`was\` to the prior value (e.g. the old column type) — grounded in the real
  migration diff. That diff-aware \`data-model\` is the headline; reach for a split
  \`diff\` of the literal SQL only when the exact statement still matters, not by
  default.
- **API / action / route change** → \`api-endpoint\` with the method, path,
  params, request, and responses as they are after the change. Flag each changed
  param/response with \`change\` (and \`was\` on a param whose type/shape changed),
  and set \`change\` on the endpoint root for a wholly added or removed route. Mark
  removed endpoints with \`deprecated: true\` and explain in prose.
  Keep multiple API endpoints in the normal single-column document flow unless
  they are an explicit before/after contract comparison.
  Author each request/response example as a SINGLE valid JSON value — one
  top-level object or array, parseable on its own — so it renders in the
  collapsible JSON explorer. Do not put \`//\` or \`/* */\` comments, prose,
  trailing commas, or two or more concatenated top-level objects inside one
  example; a non-parseable body falls back to flat text and loses the explorer.
  When an endpoint has several distinct message shapes (for example separate
  websocket frame types, or a success body versus an error body), give each its
  OWN example with its own label rather than cramming them into one body.
- **Compatibility-sensitive change** → short \`rich-text\` notes beside the
  relevant \`data-model\` / \`api-endpoint\` block. Name the changed field,
  endpoint, or behavior and mark whether it is breaking, risky, or non-breaking;
  pair that note with a split \`diff\` for the literal lines.
- **Any meaningful code hunk** → \`diff\` with \`mode: "split"\`, carrying the real
  \`before\` / \`after\` text and the \`filename\` / \`language\`. Split mode is the
  default for recap code review because before/after legibility is the point;
  use \`mode: "unified"\` only for a genuinely narrow standalone hunk where
  side-by-side would hide the code. Give every \`diff\` a one-line \`summary\`
  saying what the hunk changes and why; it renders as a description above the
  code so the reviewer reads intent first. Never leave a diff unlabeled.
  For the KEY changed files, attach \`annotations\` to the \`diff\` so the recap
  calls out what each important hunk does — this is the headline affordance for
  annotating the key files updated. Each annotation anchors to the AFTER-side
  line numbers by default (set \`side: "before"\` to point at removed lines). Keep
  it to a few high-signal notes per file, not one per line.
  When several key files each need a substantial diff, introduce the group with a
  \`rich-text\` heading block whose markdown is \`## Key changes\`, then place the
  \`diff\` blocks under it in a reusable \`tabs\` block with horizontal orientation
  (the default — omit \`orientation\`) so the selected file's split diff gets the
  full document width. Let that heading label the section — do NOT also set a
  \`title\` on the \`tabs\` block. Keep each tab label to the file path or a short
  basename plus directory hint.
  If the recap ends with more than one supporting diff, that trailing diff
  appendix should be one horizontal \`tabs\` block under its own \`## Key changes\`
  heading, not a stack of separate \`diff\` blocks.
- **Brand-new file or a substantial added block with no meaningful "before"** →
  \`annotated-code\` rather than a one-sided split \`diff\`. Carry the real new code
  with its \`filename\` / \`language\` and anchor a few high-signal notes to the lines
  that matter so the reviewer reads what the new code does, not code for code's
  sake. Keep split \`diff\` for true before/after hunks where the removed lines
  still carry meaning, and group several annotated walkthroughs in a horizontal
  \`tabs\` block the same way diffs are grouped.
- **Files added / removed / renamed** → \`file-tree\` with each entry's \`change\`
  flag (\`added\`, \`removed\`, \`modified\`, \`renamed\`) and a short \`note\`; attach a
  \`snippet\` only when one tells the reviewer something the path does not.
- **Rendered UI / interaction change** → one or more wireframes showing the
  visible UI delta before the reviewer reads code. Use \`Before\` / \`After\`
  wireframes when the comparison clarifies the change; otherwise use after-only
  or a short state/flow sequence. Use realistic UI surfaces: for a popover
  change, show a popover with its title row, top-right actions, options/fields,
  tabs, selected/disabled states, people/lists/rows, and any opened prompt/menu
  anchored to the correct trigger. If a route was added, show the route body and
  the unavailable/empty state when the diff implements one. If permissions
  changed, show what managers can do and what viewers/non-managers see instead.
  Keep the body lean: the wireframe carries the UI story, while the file tree
  and \`diff\` blocks carry implementation evidence.
- **Architecture or data-flow shift** → \`diagram\` with \`data.html\` / \`data.css\`
  as a two-panel before/after, layered, or swimlane layout, or \`mermaid\` for a
  quick graph. Use two-dimensional layouts; do not reduce a structural change to
  a left-to-right chain. Do not use \`diagram\` as a stand-in for rendered UI
  controls; UI changes need \`wireframe\` blocks.
  Author diagram HTML/CSS with the renderer-owned \`.diagram-*\` primitives
  (\`.diagram-panel\`, \`.diagram-node\`, \`.diagram-pill\`, \`[data-rough]\`, …) and
  the same \`--wf-*\` theme tokens \`references/wireframe.md\` defines — never
  \`font-family\`, hex, rgb/hsl literals, or one-off dark/light palettes.
- **Outcome-first narrative** → \`rich-text\` for the "what changed and why" prose:
  the objective the diff served, the key decisions visible in it, and the risks a
  reviewer should weigh. This is the only place the model writes freely.

## Block reference — call \`get-plan-blocks\`, do not memorize tags

The conceptual block names above (\`api-endpoint\`, \`data-model\`, \`json-explorer\`,
\`tabs\`, …) are NOT the JSX tags you author with, and the exact tags, required
fields, and prop shapes change as the block library evolves. Do not author from
memorized tags — they drift and silently produce a wrong tag (\`ApiEndpoint\`
instead of \`Endpoint\`, \`JsonExplorer\` instead of \`Json\`, \`Tabs\` instead of
\`TabsBlock\`) that errors on import.

**Before writing any structured plan content, call \`get-plan-blocks\` on the Plan
MCP connector (\`plan\` or legacy \`agent-native-plans\`).** It returns the
authoritative, always-current block
vocabulary generated live from the app's own block registry — the same config
the renderer and MDX round-trip use — so it can never be stale even if this
SKILL.md is an old installed copy:

- \`get-plan-blocks\` (default \`format: "reference"\`) → a compact table of every
  block's runtime \`type\`, exact MDX \`<Tag>\`, placement, and key data fields.
  This is your map from each conceptual name above to its real tag and props.
- \`get-plan-blocks\` with \`format: "schema"\` → the full per-block JSON Schema
  plus a worked example for each block, when you need exact field types,
  enums, or nesting (e.g. \`Diff.annotations\`, \`Endpoint.params[].in\`,
  \`DataModel.entities[].fields[]\`).

Author the recap source against the tags and schemas that call returns. The
complete set of valid block-level tags is whatever \`get-plan-blocks\` lists;
any other capitalized tag at the block level is rejected on import with an
"Unknown plan block" / "did you mean" error. Lowercase HTML tags inside
\`rich-text\`/markdown prose (\`<div>\`, \`<span>\`, \`<code>\`, \`<br>\`, …) are always
fine — only capitalized component-style block tags are validated.

A few recap-specific authoring rules the registry table cannot encode:

- Every block takes a REQUIRED \`id\` (unique across the whole plan) plus the
  shared optional \`summary\` / \`editable\` envelope; give a block a heading by
  placing a \`rich-text\` block with a Markdown \`###\` heading directly above it
  (blocks no longer take a \`title\`).
- \`Endpoint\`: prose \`description\` is the MDX **children** (body between the
  tags), not an attribute; for a WebSocket upgrade use \`method="GET"\`. Each
  request/response \`example\` is a JSON **string** (the renderer parses it into
  the JSON explorer), so keep it a single parseable JSON value.
- \`TabsBlock\`: the whole \`tabs\` array (including nested child blocks) is ONE
  JSON \`tabs={[…]}\` prop — there is NO nested \`<Tab>\` element.
- \`WireframeBlock\`: its body is a single \`<Screen surface ... html=… />\` subtree
  (nested MDX, not a flat prop); \`html\` must be a single-quoted string or static
  template literal, never a dynamic \`html={someVar}\` expression. See
  \`references/wireframe.md\` for the HTML rules.
- \`Diagram\`: the whole payload is one \`data={{ html?, css?, nodes?, edges?, … }}\`
  attribute and requires either \`html\` or at least one node; \`Mermaid\` is its
  own separate block (\`source\` text), not a \`Diagram\` prop.

## Before / After Is The Headline

The recap's center of gravity is the before/after comparison. For document-body
comparisons there are two primitives, and they cover the whole need together:

- **\`columns\`** — the side-by-side container, for **structured** comparisons.
  Use two columns labeled \`Before\` and \`After\`, each holding a block (commonly a
  \`data-model\`, \`api-endpoint\`, or \`rich-text\`), so the reviewer reads the old
  shape against the new shape in one glance. This is the right primitive for
  "the schema went from X to Y" or "the endpoint contract changed like this."
  Do not use \`columns\` simply to compact or group a list of API endpoints.
- **\`diff\`** — for **code**. It renders the literal removed and added lines. Use
  it for the actual hunks. Use split mode by default for recap code review;
  reserve \`mode: "unified"\` for genuinely narrow standalone hunks where
  side-by-side would hide the code. Key-file diff groups should use horizontal
  tabs so split diffs get the full document width.

For UI diffs, wireframes are the visual comparison primitive. Use before/after
wireframes when the comparison clarifies the change; use after-only or a state
sequence when that better matches the change. The visual headline must show
exact placement, realistic chrome, and adequate padding before any abstract
explanation. Do not stop at the first visible affordance when the diff adds a
flow; show the entry point, the opened surface, and the resulting state or page
so the reviewer can trace the actual user path. \`references/wireframe.md\` owns
the before/after layout choice —
the \`columns\` renderer keeps narrow surfaces side by side and auto-stacks wide
\`desktop\`/\`browser\` frames vertically; never hand-build a side-by-side
wireframe layout in \`custom-html\`. For document-body
comparisons, there is no other multi-column primitive — \`columns\` plus the
\`diff\` block are the whole comparison vocabulary. Do not hand-build side-by-side
layouts in \`custom-html\`, and do not stack two \`data-model\` blocks vertically
and call it a comparison when \`columns\` exists to put them side by side.

## Grounding Rule

Structured blocks are **true by construction** only if they are derived from the
actual changed lines. The \`diff\`, \`data-model\`, \`api-endpoint\`, and \`file-tree\`
blocks MUST be built mechanically from the real diff — real paths, real fields,
real method/path, real before/after text — never inferred, rounded, or invented.
The model writes only the prose: the "why", the narrative, the risk read. A
confidently wrong recap is dangerous in a review context, because a reviewer who
trusts the summary may skip the very line the summary got wrong. When the diff
does not contain a fact, leave it out rather than guess; mark anything the model
inferred (not extracted) as inferred in prose.

## Security

- **Gate visibility.** Recaps of a private repo are org/login-gated — set the
  plan's visibility to the owning org or login, never auto-public. A recap can
  expose unreleased schema, internal endpoints, and architecture; treat it like
  the source it summarizes.
- **Never transcribe secrets.** A diff can contain API keys, tokens, webhook
  URLs, signing secrets, \`.env\` values, or credential-looking literals. Do not
  copy any of these into a \`diff\`, \`file-tree\` snippet, \`api-endpoint\`, or prose
  block — redact them (\`sk-•••\`, \`<redacted>\`). This mirrors the repo's
  hardcoded-secret rule: obviously fake placeholders only, never the real value,
  in any block, caption, or note.

## Bidirectional Loop

Because a recap is a real, editable plan, the same review loop as forward plans
applies: a reviewer can annotate any block, and the coding agent reads
\`get-plan-feedback\` to drive fixes back into the code — annotation → agent →
diff, the same close-the-loop flow forward plans use. After a reviewer annotates
a block, call \`get-plan-feedback\` to read the structured feedback, then either
update the recap with \`create-visual-recap\` (passing the existing \`planId\` to
replace it in place) or apply targeted changes with \`update-visual-plan\`. The
loop is live and wired. The one thing not yet automatic is PR-comment-triggered
re-runs: the GitHub Action creates an initial recap per PR, but it does not yet
re-run automatically when new review feedback is posted in GitHub — that
auto-re-run is the remaining fast-follow.

## Related Skills

- **visual-plan** — the canonical command and the source of the shared Wireframe
  & Canvas and Document Quality cores; a recap follows the same block discipline
  in reverse.
- **comment anchors** — recap comments use the same anchor rules as forward
  plans; see "Interpreting comment anchors" in the visual-plan skill for
  coordinate frames, wireframe node ids, text-quote resolution, detached
  threads, routing via \`resolutionTarget\`, and two-axis consumed/resolved state.
- **security** — data scoping, secret handling, and the hardcoded-secret rule the
  recap's redaction and visibility gating mirror.
- **sharing** — org/login-gated visibility for the plan that holds the recap.
