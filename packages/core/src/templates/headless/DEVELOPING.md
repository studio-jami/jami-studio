# Developing {{APP_NAME}}

Install dependencies, then run the hello action:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm action hello '{"name":"Builder"}'
```

`actions/run.ts` is only the shared CLI dispatcher that powers
`pnpm action <name>`. Add real agent-callable actions as separate files such as
`actions/hello.ts`.

Then run the production app-agent loop against this folder:

```bash
pnpm agent "Call hello for Builder"
```

Useful checks:

```bash
pnpm typecheck
```

This scaffold intentionally has no `app/` directory, React Router config, Vite config, or dev server. Add those only when you are ready for a UI surface; the Chat template is the UI-first scaffold.
