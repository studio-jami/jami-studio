# Content

Content is open-source Obsidian for MDX: a local-file-friendly document
workspace where the agent can read, write, reorganize, and publish pages for
you. Open a doc, ask "rewrite this paragraph to be more concise" or "create a
page called Q4 Planning with sub-pages for Goals, Metrics, and Risks" - same
result whether you do it yourself or ask.

```an-wireframe
{
  "surface": "desktop",
  "html": "<div style='display:grid;grid-template-columns:210px 1fr;gap:14px;padding:16px;min-height:500px;box-sizing:border-box'><aside class='wf-card' style='display:flex;flex-direction:column;gap:10px'><strong>Content</strong><span class='wf-pill accent'>Q3 Roadmap</span><span class='wf-pill'>Goals</span><span class='wf-pill'>Metrics</span><span class='wf-pill'>Risks</span><hr/><span class='wf-pill'>Engineering wiki</span><span class='wf-pill'>Reading list</span><span class='wf-pill'>Weekly sync</span></aside><main style='display:flex;flex-direction:column;gap:12px;min-width:0;padding:8px 20px'><div style='display:flex;align-items:center;gap:10px'><h1 style='margin:0'>Q3 Roadmap</h1><div style='flex:1'></div><button>Share</button><button class='primary'>Publish</button></div><div class='wf-card' style='flex:1;display:flex;flex-direction:column;gap:12px;padding:22px'><h2 style='margin:0'>Launch goals</h2><p style='margin:0'>Ship the onboarding flow, reduce setup time, and document owner handoffs.</p><div class='wf-box'>At a glance · owner, window, status</div><div class='wf-box'>Top objectives</div><div class='wf-box'>Workstreams table</div></div></main></div>"
}
```

When you open the app, you'll see a page tree next to the editor. The agent always knows which page you're viewing and what text you have selected, so document edits can stay grounded in the current page.

}
```

## What you can do with it

- **Write rich text** with headings, lists, tables, code blocks, images, and links. Slash commands (`/`) insert blocks; selecting text pops up a formatting toolbar.
- **Organize pages in a tree** — nest infinitely, drag to reorder, favorite pages you use often.
- **Search across everything** with full-text search across titles and content.
- **Edit local Markdown/MDX files like Obsidian.** Use the `/local-files` view
  to export your workspace to files, edit them in your own tools, preview
  changes, and import them back. In Local File Mode, Content writes straight to
  the selected `.md` or `.mdx` file.
- **Generate rich interactive custom blocks.** Register local React components,
  insert them as MDX, and let the agent create or update component files for
  your docs.
- **Sync with Notion.** Link a local doc to a Notion page and pull or push content in either direction. Comments sync both ways too.
- **Collaborate in real time.** Multiple people (and the agent) can edit the same doc at the same time.
- **Share docs** with teammates or make them public — private by default, with viewer / editor / admin roles.
- **Ask the agent for anything**: "Rewrite this paragraph." "Add a TL;DR at the top." "Find all my meeting notes from last week." "Make this tone more formal."

## Getting started

Live demo: [content.agent-native.com](https://content.agent-native.com).

When you open the app, click **+ New page** in the sidebar, give it a title, and start writing. To use the agent, type in the sidebar:

- "Create a page called Onboarding and add three sub-pages under it."
- "Rewrite this paragraph to be more concise." (with a page open)
- "Add a section about pricing with three bullet points."
- "Summarize this doc into a TL;DR at the top."
- "Pull the latest from Notion." (after linking a Notion page)

Select text and hit Cmd+I to focus the agent with that selection pre-loaded — "make this punchier" then operates on exactly what you highlighted.

## Local Markdown/MDX files {#local-files}

Content can round-trip documents through local files without cloning or running
the Content app locally. It feels like Obsidian for MDX: files stay inspectable
and editable, while the app gives you a rich editor, agent actions, sharing, and
custom blocks. Open `/local-files`, choose a folder in your browser or Agent
Native Desktop, and export the current document tree as Markdown/MDX under
`content/`.

Each exported file contains frontmatter for document metadata (`id`, `title`,
`parentId`, `position`, favorite/search/visibility flags, and `updatedAt`) plus
the document body as Markdown. You can edit those files in your normal editor,
then return to `/local-files` to preview and import changes back into Content.

This workflow is useful when you want content in source control, want to batch
edit docs with local tools, or want a no-clone path for teams that prefer files
as the review surface. The hosted app remains the source of truth for sharing,
comments, permissions, and live collaboration; the local folder is an explicit
sync surface.

Content can also run in **Local File Mode**, where files are the source of
truth instead of SQL documents. Add `agent-native.json` to a repo, set
`mode: "local-files"`, and configure roots such as `docs/`, `blog/`,
`content/`, and `resources/`. The standard Content editor then populates its
left sidebar from those local `.md`/`.mdx` files and writes edits back to the
selected file through the normal document actions. Use this for repo-first docs,
blogs, resource libraries, or Obsidian-style personal content with MDX-powered
components; switch back to database mode when you want hosted collaboration and
SQL-backed sharing. See [Local File Mode](/docs/local-file-mode) for the
standalone repo layout, configuration, custom MDX components, local
`extensions/` widgets, and production safety guide.

To install the Content local-files skill into an existing repo:

```bash
npx @agent-native/core@latest skills add content --mode local-files --scope project
```

The installer copies the `content` skill for your coding agent and writes or
updates `agent-native.json` with Content roots for `docs/`, `blog/`, `content/`,
and `resources/`. When a local Content app, Agent Native Desktop, or trusted
local bridge is running, agents should use Content actions such as
`list-documents`, `get-document`, `edit-document`, `update-document`, and
`share-local-file-document` instead of raw filesystem writes. Without that local
bridge, the installed skill still gives the agent the repo-editing contract for
safe Markdown/MDX edits.

## For developers

The rest of this doc is for anyone forking the Content template or extending it.

### Quick start

Scaffold a new workspace with the Content template:

```bash
npx @agent-native/core@latest create my-workspace --standalone --template content
cd my-workspace
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://localhost:8083` and create your first page. Then ask the agent to "create a page called Onboarding and add three sub-pages under it".

### Key features {#key-features}

**Nested pages.** Documents form a draggable tree with favorites, icons, ordering, and page-level sharing.

**Rich MDX editor.** Tiptap powers headings, lists, tables, code blocks, images, links, slash commands, selection toolbars, and local React components.

**Live collaboration.** Yjs keeps multiple editors and agent edits in sync without clobbering each other.

**Search and comments.** Full-text search, anchored comments, version history, and restore flows are built into the document surface.

**Sync surfaces.** Documents can sync with Notion or local Markdown/MDX folders, with SQL acting as the collaborative cache/history layer.

### Local file sync

The protected `/local-files` route uses the browser File System Access API, or a
guarded native folder bridge inside Agent Native Desktop, to read and write
Markdown/MDX files from a user-chosen folder. After the folder is linked and
imported, the selected file is treated as the authority: opening the page reads
the file, and normal editor saves write the file first. SQL is then updated as a
cache/history layer for the existing document UI, search, and version panel, not
as the source of truth. The top-right page menu exposes the local source path:
relative path is always available, absolute path is available in true local-file
mode and Agent Native Desktop, and Reveal in Finder is available through the
desktop bridge or server-backed local-file mode.

The bulk sync route calls:

- `export-content-source` — reads the accessible document tree and returns a
  deterministic `content/` file bundle.
- `import-content-source` — validates files, creates new private documents,
  updates documents where the caller has editor access, preserves version
  history, and rejects invalid parent cycles.

The source format lives in `shared/content-source.ts`. Keep that file as the
single contract for filenames, frontmatter, parsing, and serialization.

Local file workspaces can also provide repo-local React components through the
configured `components` folder. The Content dev server imports PascalCase
exports from those files, renders matching MDX tags such as `<ImpactCounter />`
inside the editor, and exposes them in the slash menu under Local components.
This is the "Obsidian for MDX" layer: custom MDX blocks stay local to the
workspace, but the editor can render them and the agent can generate or update
their source without cloning the Content app. A minimal workspace component can
be:

```tsx
// components/ImpactCounter.tsx
import { useState } from "react";

export function ImpactCounter({
  label = "points",
  start = 3,
}: {
  label?: string;
  start?: number;
}) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(start);
  return (
    <button type="button" onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Impact: {count} {label}
    </button>
  );
}

export const ImpactCounterInputs = {
  label: { type: "string", label: "Label", default: "points" },
  start: { type: "number", label: "Starting count", default: 3 },
};
```

Use it in local MDX as `<ImpactCounter />`, or insert it from the editor slash
menu under Local components. When input metadata is exported, selecting the
component in the editor shows a corner edit button that rewrites the MDX props
in the local file.

The browser **Local files** picker can read and write `.md` and `.mdx` files on
its own, but executable React component previews require a local compiler. Run
Content locally or use Agent Native Desktop so the selected workspace path can
be registered with the local Content dev server. Vite then imports
`components/*.tsx`, hot reloads edits to existing component files, and reloads
the component registry when files are added or removed. Agents can use
`list-local-component-files` and `write-local-component-file` to inspect or
update registered component files while the editor updates from the same source.

### Comments

Threaded comments on documents with quoted-text anchors, replies, and resolve state. Backed by the `document_comments` table and `app/components/editor/CommentsSidebar.tsx`. Actions: `list-comments`, `add-comment`. Notion comments can sync both ways via `sync-notion-comments`.

### Version history

Every significant update snapshots a row in the `document_versions` table. The UI surfaces these in `app/components/editor/VersionHistoryPanel.tsx`.

### Sharing and visibility

Documents are private by default. You can change visibility to `org` or `public`, or grant per-user and per-org roles (`viewer`, `editor`, `admin`). The framework's auto-mounted sharing actions work out of the box:

- `share-resource --resourceType document --resourceId <id> --principalType user --principalId <email> --role editor`
- `unshare-resource` / `list-resource-shares` / `set-resource-visibility`

See the `sharing` skill.

### Teams

A dedicated team page at `/team` (see `app/routes/_app.team.tsx`) uses the framework's `TeamPage` component for creating orgs and managing members.

### Working with the agent

Because the agent sees your current screen, most prompts don't need you to reference a document explicitly. When you have a page open, "this" means that page.

For small edits, the agent uses `edit-document --find ... --replace ...` so only the changed text flows through Yjs — you'll see the diff applied in place rather than the whole page re-render. For bigger rewrites it uses `update-document --content ...`.

If you select text and press Cmd+I (or focus the agent panel), the selection travels with your next message as context, so "make this punchier" operates on exactly what you highlighted.

### Databases and properties

Documents can host inline databases — Notion-style tables where each row is itself a document. The agent can create databases, add items, configure column definitions, and set property values through actions: `create-content-database`, `add-database-item`, `set-document-property`. Property definitions (type, visibility, options, position) live in `document_property_definitions`; per-row values live in `document_property_values`.

### Additional actions

Beyond the CRUD surface in the data model, the template ships `export-document` for converting a page to Markdown or HTML, `transcribe-media` for attaching a transcript to a page, and `restore-document-version` for rolling back to an earlier snapshot.

### Data model

Nine tables, all defined in `server/db/schema.ts`:

- **`documents`** — the page tree. Columns: `id`, `parent_id`, `title`, `content` (markdown), `icon`, `position`, `is_favorite`, `visibility`, `owner_email`, `org_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
- **`document_versions`** — full snapshots of title and content for version history. Roll back with `restore-document-version`.
- **`document_comments`** — threaded comments with `thread_id`, `parent_id`, `quoted_text`, `resolved`, and an optional `notion_comment_id` for bidirectional Notion sync.
- **`document_sync_links`** — one row per Notion-linked document tracking remote page ID, last sync times, conflict state, content hash, and errors.
- **`document_property_definitions`** — column definitions for inline databases: name, type, visibility, options, and position.
- **`content_databases`** — inline database objects attached to a `document_id` with a title and view config JSON.
- **`content_database_items`** — rows in an inline database, each linking a `database_id` to a `document_id`.
- **`document_property_values`** — per-document property values (`property_id` → `value_json`).
- **`document_shares`** — per-user and per-org grants created via `createSharesTable`.

```

Content is stored as markdown. The editor converts to and from the Tiptap JSON model in memory; the SQL row is always markdown so actions, search, and Notion sync can operate on a single canonical format.

All ownable tables include `owner_email` and `org_id` via `ownableColumns()`, so every row is scoped to the signed-in user (and optionally their active organization) from the moment it's created.

### Customizing it

The four places to look when changing behavior:

- **`actions/`** — every operation the agent or UI can perform. Add a new file like `actions/publish-to-wordpress.ts` using `defineAction` and both sides get it for free. Key existing actions: `create-document.ts`, `edit-document.ts`, `update-document.ts`, `delete-document.ts`, `list-documents.ts`, `search-documents.ts`, `get-document.ts`, `pull-notion-page.ts`, `push-notion-page.ts`, `add-comment.ts`, `view-screen.ts`, `navigate.ts`.
- **`app/routes/`** — the page surface. `_app.tsx` is the pathless layout that keeps the sidebar and agent panel mounted; `_app._index.tsx` is the landing view; `_app.page.$id.tsx` is the editor route; `_app.team.tsx` is the team settings page.
- **`app/components/editor/`** — the Tiptap editor. Add a new node type under `extensions/` and register it in `DocumentEditor.tsx`. The bubble toolbar, slash menu, and hover previews are all component files you can edit.
- **`.agents/skills/`** — guidance the agent reads before acting. If you add a new capability (say, a CMS publishing pipeline), drop a `SKILL.md` in a new skill folder so the agent uses it correctly. Existing skills: `document-editing`, `notion-integration`, `real-time-sync`, `delegate-to-agent`, `storing-data`, `self-modifying-code`, `security`, `frontend-design`, `create-skill`, `capture-learnings`.
- **`AGENTS.md`** — the top-level agent guide with the action cheatsheet and common-tasks table. Update it whenever you add a major feature so the agent discovers it without exploring.
- **`server/db/schema.ts`** — data model. Add a column or table here. The Content template has no `db:push` script; it relies on strictly additive migrations that run on startup. Edit `server/db/schema.ts`, write a matching additive migration, and the change applies the next time the app boots — schema updates must never drop, rename, or destructively alter existing tables or columns (see [Database](/docs/database#migrations) for guidelines).
- **`shared/notion-markdown.ts`** — markdown-to-Notion-blocks conversion. Extend this if you add new block types that need to round-trip through Notion.

The agent can make all of these changes itself — ask it to "add a tags column to documents and expose it in the sidebar" and it will update the schema, migrate, wire the UI, and write the action.
