# Visual Edit

Use `/visual-edit` when the user wants to inspect or edit a real local app
visually instead of generating standalone Alpine HTML. The source of truth is
the running localhost app plus its route URLs. Design shows those routes as
iframe-backed screens on the infinite canvas.

## Core Model

- Each screen is a URL-backed iframe, not copied HTML.
- Each screen keeps URL metadata: `connectionId`, `routeId`, `path`,
  `url`, `bridgeUrl`, title, and viewport size.
- Start in Design's screen overview mode. In overview, screens are static
  design frames; full-screen focus is for scrolling and app interaction.
- Alt-drag duplicates a screen. For localhost screens, duplication copies the
  iframe frame and URL metadata; change the copy's path/query for a new state.
- Flow visualization is multiple URL states: `/checkout?step=shipping`,
  `/checkout?step=payment`, `/checkout?step=done`, etc.
- When the user gives a named flow or numbered screen list, preserve that order
  and create one screen per URL/path. Shorthand like
  `localhost:1234/onboarding/1` means
  `http://localhost:1234/onboarding/1`.

## Review Quality

- Treat the running app as the truth. Preserve its component language, tokens,
  route state, and real content unless the user explicitly asks for a new visual
  direction.
- Use multiple URL states to reveal meaningful UX moments: empty/loading/error
  states, focused panels, modals, responsive breakpoints, and completed flow
  steps when those matter to the review.
- For visual edits, compare before/after at the relevant viewport sizes and
  check key hover/focus/scroll states when the app exposes them.

## Account And Sharing Model

- The `/visual-edit` entry route can open before the viewer signs in. Public
  `/design/:id` editor links can also render read-only public designs without a
  session.
- Prefer links returned by Design actions or `/_agent-native/open` deep links.
  Do not surface URLs with `_session=` tokens. Query sessions are only a
  fallback after normal cookie resolution, so an existing browser session can
  still open the design as a different user and show "Design not found".
- Do not attempt anonymous write actions. Bridge registration, design creation,
  screen placement, generation, saving, and sharing are account-backed. If a
  signed-out visitor wants to save or share, send them through the framework
  sign-in return flow, then save or copy the design into that account before
  opening the share dialog.

## Required Local Bridge

From the target app repo, make sure its dev server is running, then run:

```bash
npx @agent-native/core@latest design connect --url http://localhost:5173 --root . --daemon
```

Use the app's real port. The command starts a detached local bridge on
`http://127.0.0.1:7331` by default, waits for `/health`, prints the
manifest JSON, and keeps the bridge alive after the agent command exits.

For a manual health/manifest check:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:7331/manifest.json
```

Do not use `--json` for an editable session. `--json`, `--once`, and
`--dry-run` print the manifest and exit, so Design will fall back to a
non-editable live iframe as soon as it tries to refresh the snapshot.

## Action Flow

Prefer the single authenticated `open-visual-edit` action. It registers or
refreshes the localhost bridge, creates or reuses a Design project, places
URL-backed screens, stores the active visual-edit context, and navigates to
overview mode in one call. This avoids creating a private design under a
synthetic CLI user and then handing the browser a tokenized URL that may be
shadowed by an existing session.

```bash
pnpm action open-visual-edit '{
  "title": "Docs homepage visual edit",
  "devServerUrl": "http://localhost:5173",
  "bridgeUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:7331",
  "rootPath": "/absolute/path/to/app",
  "routeManifest": { "...": "from /manifest.json" },
  "paths": ["/", "/pricing", "/checkout?step=payment"]
}'
```

The action returns `designId`, `connectionId`, `screens`, `urlPath`, and
`openUrl`. Keep those IDs in the chat context for follow-ups.

For a numbered flow the user describes in chat, keep the labels and order:

```bash
pnpm action open-visual-edit '{
  "designId": "<existing-design-id>",
  "connectionId": "<existing-connection-id>",
  "devServerUrl": "http://localhost:1234",
  "routes": [
    { "url": "localhost:1234/onboarding/1", "title": "Screen 1" },
    { "url": "localhost:1234/onboarding/2", "title": "Screen 2" },
    { "url": "localhost:1234/onboarding/3", "title": "Screen 3" }
  ]
}'
```

For responsive follow-ups, call `open-visual-edit` again with the same
`designId` and `connectionId`, plus explicit viewport dimensions:

```bash
pnpm action open-visual-edit '{
  "designId": "<existing-design-id>",
  "connectionId": "<existing-connection-id>",
  "devServerUrl": "http://localhost:5173",
  "paths": ["/"],
  "defaultWidth": 390,
  "defaultHeight": 844,
  "startX": 1600,
  "startY": 0
}'
```

If no `routes` or `paths` are supplied, `open-visual-edit` uses every route
from the localhost manifest.

Fallback, only when `open-visual-edit` is unavailable:

1. Register or refresh the bridge with `connect-localhost`, passing the
   `/manifest.json` result as `routeManifest` and `capabilities`.
2. Create or reuse a Design project with `create-design`.
3. Place URL-backed screens with `add-localhost-screens`.
4. Navigate to overview mode with `navigate`.

## Open The Design Surface

- Use the `link`, `deepLink`, or MCP App embed returned by Design actions so
  the user sees the canvas. In Codex Desktop or VS Code, prefer opening that
  Design URL in the available preview/webview panel; otherwise surface the
  "Open design" link.
- Return or open the `openUrl` / action link, not a hand-built
  `/design/:id?_session=...` URL.
- If the user is working in VS Code, the Agent Native extension can open the
  same URL via
  `vscode://builder.agent-native/open?url=<encoded-design-url>`. Its
  `Agent Native: Open Design Canvas` command also starts the local bridge and
  opens hosted Design in the VS Code side panel.
- After `add-localhost-screens`, confirm the Design editor is in overview mode
  with the requested URL-backed frames visible. Do not stop at "screens added"
  when the user asked to inspect or edit visually.

## Editing URLs

Keep localhost screens as URL files plus `screenMetadata[fileId]`. Do not
replace them with copied `srcdoc` HTML unless the user explicitly asks for a
frozen snapshot. To change a state, rerun `add-localhost-screens` with the new
path/query or duplicate the screen and update the copy's URL metadata.

## Verification

- `list-localhost-connections` returns the expected connection and routes.
- The Design editor opens in overview mode.
- Every requested screen renders the intended localhost URL.
- Alt-dragging a screen copies the URL-backed frame, not an inline HTML clone.
