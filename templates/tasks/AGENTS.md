# tasks — Agent Guide

Tasks is a task-list-first agent-native app. The task list at `/tasks` is the default home; chat stays available for capture and agent operations. Actions are the contract shared by UI, chat, HTTP, MCP, A2A, and CLI.

## Core Rules

- Never hardcode API keys, tokens, webhook URLs, signing secrets, private Builder/internal data, customer data, or credential-looking literals. Use secrets/OAuth/runtime configuration and obvious placeholders in examples.
- Follow the root framework contract: data in SQL, actions first, application state for navigation/selection, and shared agent chat for AI work.
- Use actions for app operations and keep frontend/API parity.
- Prefer improving the action surface before adding new pages. The task list is the primary durable UI for MVP.
- Keep the action surface small: task CRUD actions plus `reorder-tasks`, `view-screen`, and `navigate`.
- Do not use `db-query` for normal task operations.
- Call `view-screen` first when the user's visible task context matters (especially on `/tasks`).

## Store Functions And Transactions

Every store in `server/**/store.ts` exposes full CRUD for its entity: `create`,
`get` + `list`, `update`, `delete`. Naming follows three rules:

- **Unsuffixed means "by ids."** `deleteCustomFieldValues({ ids })` deletes by
  value id. Any other selector is explicit: `deleteCustomFieldValuesByTaskIds`,
  `deleteCustomFieldValuesByFieldIds`, `updateCustomFieldValuesByTaskId`.
- **The plural is the implementation; the singular delegates to it** with a
  one-element id list. `deleteTask` calls `deleteTasks`, `updateCustomFieldValue`
  calls `updateCustomFieldValues`. Never write the same query twice.
- **`list` takes every selector as optional** rather than splitting into `ByX`
  variants — `listStoredItems({ ids?, includeDone? })`,
  `listCustomFieldValues({ ids?, taskIds?, fieldIds? })`.

Where a patch is genuinely per-row (custom field title/config, a task's field
values), the bulk form takes one entry per id instead of one patch across ids.
Upsert counts as create; do not add a separate `create` for upserted rows.

Action names are a separate public surface and do not follow this convention:
the `bulk-delete-tasks` action still exists and calls `deleteTasks`.

Every function takes the database handle as an **optional trailing argument**,
so it runs standalone or joins a caller's transaction. The handle is defined
once, in `server/db/transaction.ts`:

```ts
export type DbHandle = Pick<
  ReturnType<typeof getDb>,
  "select" | "insert" | "update" | "delete" | "transaction"
>;
```

## Commit Message Conventions

- Never include `Made-with: Cursor` in commit messages. Remove it if it appears
  in a generated message.
- Use one of these prefixes:
  - `feature: ...` or `feature(PROJECT): ...`
  - `fix: ...` or `fix(PROJECT): ...`
  - `refactor: ...` or `refactor(PROJECT): ...`
  - `technical: ...` or `technical(PROJECT): ...`
  - `chore: ...` or `chore(PROJECT): ...`
- `PROJECT` is optional. If provided, it must be one of `generator` or `web`.
- Before creating any commit, always:
  - ask for confirmation,
  - show the proposed commit message first,
  - commit only after explicit user approval.

## Application State

Default navigation shape on `/tasks`:

```json
{
  "view": "tasks",
  "path": "/tasks",
  "includeDone": false,
  "taskId": "optional-selected-id",
  "fieldId": "optional-selected-field-id"
}
```

- `includeDone` mirrors the task-list filter toggle (incomplete only vs show all).
- `taskId` highlights a row when opened from a deep link; MVP has no detail page.
- `fieldId` highlights a custom field when opened from a deep link; the Fields page manages definitions.
- Chat lives at `/chat`. Root `/` redirects to `/tasks`.

## Agent behavior (MVP)

- Capture in chat → `create-inbox-item` by default; use `create-task` only when the user asks to add directly to the task list.
- Call `view-screen` before ambiguous edits when the user says "this task", "these tasks", "this inbox item", or "the list".
- On `/tasks` or `/inbox`, `view-screen` returns `list` (with `items`), optional `selectedItem` (`inListSnapshot`), and optional `selection` (`selectedItems`, `selectedIdsNotInVisibleList`) when bulk-select is active.
- When the user asks to see, review, or manage tasks while `navigation.view` is not `tasks`, call `render-task-list-inline` instead of navigating away. Pass `includeDone: true` when completed tasks should be included. The widget can add tasks and toggle completion through the existing task actions.
- When the user is already on `/tasks`, use `view-screen` and the native task list for task-list context unless the user explicitly asks for an inline widget.
- Prefer `selection.selectedItems` when the user has UI rows selected; fall back to `selectedItem` for a single deep-link highlight.
- `delete-task`, `bulk-delete-tasks`, and `delete-inbox-item` only after explicit user confirmation in chat.
- Use `navigation.includeDone` and `list` from `view-screen` to match what the user sees on `/tasks`.
- Use `reorder-tasks` with the same `includeDone` flag when moving tasks in the visible list.
- Use `list-custom-fields`, `create-custom-field`, `update-custom-field`, and `delete-custom-field` for field definitions.
- Use `reorder-custom-fields` with every field id in the desired order when moving fields in the Fields list.
- Use `list-visible-task-fields` and `update-visible-task-fields` to read or change which fields appear on task cards (max 3, persisted per user in SQL).
- Use `list-tasks` with `includeFields` to read per-task custom values and `update-task` with `fieldValues` to set or clear them; empty values clear the stored row.
- On `/tasks`, `view-screen` includes `visibleTaskFields` from stored prefs for the custom fields currently shown on task cards and `selectedTaskFields` for a highlighted task.
- On `/fields`, `view-screen` returns the field-definition list and `selectedItem` when a field is highlighted.
- Custom field types are `text`, `rich_text`, `number`, `percent`, `currency`, `single_select`, `multi_select`, and `date`.
- Number, percent, and currency field `precision` limits decimal places; `precision: 0` means whole numbers only. Number fields also support optional `positiveOnly`.
- Select option colors are named tokens: `red`, `orange`, `yellow`, `green`, `blue`, `purple`, `pink`, and `gray`.
- `delete-custom-field` only after explicit user confirmation; warn that deleting the definition removes its values on every task.
- After code changes, include the **Change summary** from the `change-summary` skill (Code / Tests / Config / Docs with line counts).
