# Design — Agent Guide

Design is an agent-native prototyping app. The agent creates and edits complete
interactive HTML prototypes, design systems, variants, and handoff exports
through actions against the shared SQL state.

Keep this file essential. Detailed generation, design-system, export, and UI
patterns live in `.agents/skills/`.

## Core Rules

- Store large file/blob payloads in configured file/blob storage, not SQL: no
  base64, `data:` URLs, images, video/audio, PDFs, ZIPs, screenshots,
  thumbnails, or replay chunks in app tables, `application_state`, `settings`,
  or `resources`; persist URLs, ids, or handles instead.
- Never hardcode API keys, tokens, webhook URLs, signing secrets, private Builder/internal data, customer data, or credential-looking literals. Use secrets/OAuth/runtime configuration and obvious placeholders in examples.
- Use the app actions for designs, files, versions, design systems, variants,
  export, and sharing. Do not write design rows directly with SQL.
- Treat repository import actions as shortcuts, not capability limits. When the
  exact GitHub endpoint, search query, request body, pagination mode, metadata
  field, or API version matters, use `provider-api-catalog`,
  `provider-api-docs`, and `provider-api-request` against the real GitHub API.
  The provider API resolves auth from the saved `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret and never
  exposes the token value. For large scans, stage results with `stageAs` and
  analyze them with `query-staged-dataset`.
- In dev, call actions with `pnpm action <name>`; in production, call the native
  tool. The action schema is the source of truth for parameters.
- Call `view-screen` before editing a specific design if the current design or
  selected file is not already clear from context.
- Generated files must be complete, standalone HTML unless the user asks for a
  different export format. They should render in the iframe without a build step.
- For design generation, ground the work in a concrete audience, primary job,
  and visual thesis before writing. For existing products, inspect current
  screens, linked design systems, tokens, and component language before
  inventing a new direction. Use realistic content/copy and one signature choice
  per direction; avoid lorem ipsum, generic SaaS filler, and decorative
  placeholders. Include expected responsive/accessibility states, run
  `run-design-audit`, and call `take-design-screenshot` on each changed screen
  before calling it ready — see the `design-generation` skill's Phase 5.
- For editable reusable building blocks inside Design, use
  `list-design-native-assets` first, then `insert-design-native-asset` with the
  chosen kind. These are Design-native HTML primitives/components, not external
  media, so prefer them when the user asks for a Figma Assets-style library that
  supports our own primitives.
- For raster image generation, restyling, or editing existing screenshots/photos,
  use the available first-party Assets MCP tool such as `generate-asset` instead
  of placeholders or generic stock imagery. Default to `tier: "fast"` (the cheap
  Gemini flash "nanobanana"-class model) unless the user explicitly asks for
  best quality; pass `aspectRatio` matching the layout slot (e.g. `21:9` hero,
  `4:3` card, `1:1` avatar); include the linked design system's
  `imageStyle.styleDescription` in the prompt when one is linked; and always
  pass `callerAppId: "design"`. When the Assets picker returns a
  selected asset, preserve `assetId`, `runId`, and URLs verbatim; if a design is
  open, call `insert-asset` with the chosen URL/id, then refine placement with
  `get-design-snapshot` and `edit-design` as needed. If no Assets MCP tool is
  available, use the first-party Assets app via `call-agent` with agent
  `"assets"` when available. If the user attached an image, use its hosted
  chat-attachment URL or call `upload-image` to create one before delegating. If
  no image/upload provider is configured, say that specific setup is needed and
  continue any non-image Design work separately.
- For reusable Figma library components, use `list-figma-library-assets` with a
  Figma file URL or file key. It returns components/component sets with
  thumbnails, rendered insert URLs, and Figma provenance. Insert with
  `insert-figma-library-asset`, preserving `fileKey`, `nodeId`, `componentKey`,
  `sourceUrl`, and the rendered URL. This path requires the saved
  `FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN` secret; never ask the user to paste that token into chat
  or pass it as an action parameter. Figma styles and variables are design-system
  inputs, not draggable media assets; route full file/design-system extraction
  through Builder-backed indexing.
- To import a Figma frame/screen as a real, editable Design screen (not a
  rendered image), use `import-figma-frame` with a `figmaUrl` (or
  `fileKey`/`nodeId`) — it maps position, auto-layout, text, fills/gradients,
  strokes, corner radii, effects, opacity, and blend modes pixel-accurately,
  falling back to an exact PNG only for vector networks/boolean ops/unsupported
  node types, and saves the result as a new screen. Read the returned
  `fidelityReport` (`approximated`, `imageFallbacks`) back to the user when
  non-trivial. Use `get-figma-styles` for a file's published style names (not
  the Enterprise Variables API; full token extraction still routes through
  Builder-backed indexing). See the `design-systems` skill's "Import from
  Figma" section.
- Use Alpine.js and Tailwind CDN for interactive prototypes. Prefer Alpine
  directives over raw inline event handlers.
- Navigate between prototype screens with Alpine state (`x-show`), a
  `data-screen="file.html"` attribute, or `#` anchors — never real/relative
  URLs, which would navigate the preview iframe to the app itself.
- To refine an existing design, make the smallest change: read it with
  `get-design-snapshot`, then use `edit-design` (search/replace). Reserve
  `generate-design` for new files. For broad rewrites of an existing selected
  file, use `edit-design` with `mode: "replace-file"` and the exact `fileId`;
  never resend files you aren't changing.
- When the user asks to add tweak controls, preserve existing useful tweaks,
  add or update the requested `tweaks` definitions, and make sure each control
  is backed by a CSS custom property the rendered file actually uses. If source
  edits are needed, use `get-design-snapshot` first and persist the complete
  updated tweak definition list through `generate-design`.
- Design editor extensions render in the right inspector slot
  `design.editor.inspector`. When creating an extension for that panel, call
  `create-extension`, then `add-extension-slot-target` with that slot id, then
  `install-extension` so it appears inline. Extensions receive
  `window.slotContext` with the current design id, active screen, selected
  element, zoom, mode, tool, and tweak values. For AI-driven style/artboard
  changes, extension HTML should call `agentNative.chat.send(...)` with the
  selected element selector/sourceId and request; the agent should call
  `view-screen` first, prefer `apply-visual-edit` for element style/class/text
  changes, and use `update-design` or `generate-design` with `canvasFrames` for
  overview artboard placement changes. If creating the extension opens the
  standalone extension editor, return to the same design with `navigate` and
  `inspectorTab: "extensions"` after installing it.
- Follow linked design-system tokens and `customInstructions` whenever present;
  explicit user instructions in the current turn still win.
- For reusable design-system setup from Figma, connected code/GitHub, local
  code/design files, or optional `design.md`, use Builder-backed DSI indexing
  through `index-design-system-with-builder` or `import-file --format fig`.
  Pass readable `design.md` content as `designMd`, use the returned local design
  system id in Design flows, and call `get-design-system` before generation to
  hydrate Builder docs/tokens when available. Do not create a duplicate local
  design system from raw Figma/code sources.
- When a user wants one-off tokens from design.md, CSS, theme/tokens JSON,
  Tailwind config, local files, or the current design, call
  `import-design-tokens` and preserve its `tokens`, `filesAnalyzed`, and
  provenance in your answer. Manual `apply-design-token-edit` / one-by-one
  token entry is the fallback for a small one-off token, not the primary import
  workflow.
- Persist useful work early: create/update the design and files as soon as a
  coherent candidate exists, then iterate.
- For a brief or ambiguous _new_ design prompt, ask before generating:
  create/open the design shell, call `show-design-questions` with a small
  tailored set, stop while the main canvas shows the questions, then continue
  from the user's answers. Skip asking when the prompt is already specific,
  it's a tweak/edit to an existing design, the user already answered a
  question set for this design and is now iterating, or they say "decide for
  me"/"surprise me"/"just build it" — see the `design-generation` skill for
  how to size and word the questions.
- For multiple screens/states, call `generate-screens` first. It opens the
  infinite screen overview and returns target filenames plus `canvasFrame`
  placements. Then call `generate-design` with those files and pass the matching
  `canvasFrames` entries so screens appear in the overview instead of only in
  the file list.
- After generation or broad updates, leave the user in the screen overview when
  the work involves multiple screens or artboard placement. Overview is the
  primary editing surface: users can select screens, move/resize/drop static
  frames and canvas primitives, edit layers in place, and use the frame's
  full-view button to enter focused editing.
- To move the user's editor, call `navigate` with `view: "editor"` and
  `editorView: "overview"` for the screen overview, or `editorView: "single"`
  plus `fileId`, `filename`, or `screen` to focus one screen.
- Single-screen mode is for scrolling, interacting with prototype behavior, and
  editing the DOM/code layers inside one screen. Do not use it as the default
  landing mode for multi-screen generation unless the user asks to focus a
  specific screen.
- The layers panel shows screens as top-level frames and nests DOM/code layers
  beneath the active screen. Rename DOM/code layers by safely editing source to
  set `data-agent-native-layer-name`; this is the stable human-readable layer
  name. `data-code-layer-id` and similar ids are for selection stability, not
  display naming.
- For inline/Alpine screens, stamp and preserve unique
  `data-agent-native-node-id` attributes on selectable DOM nodes. Treat
  generated CSS selectors as a compatibility fallback only. For localhost React
  screens, resolve through build-time source/debug metadata (stable generated
  ids, component name, file, and line) before falling back to selectors.
- For inline/Alpine motion, use `get-motion-timeline` to inspect the active
  file's saved or CSS-recovered timeline, then call `apply-motion-edit` with the
  same `sourceRef`/`fileId` to update it. Motion edits persist as durable
  managed keyframes in `<style data-agent-native-motion>` plus editable timeline
  metadata; it is not a one-way export. Real CSS module or `motion/react`
  write-back remains a localhost/fusion follow-up capability.
- For multi-variant work, use `present-design-variants` so every candidate is
  saved as a normal overview-board screen and the user gets one inline chat
  button per screen name. Keep each variant compact: prefer concise labels,
  descriptions, accent colors, and feature bullets, and omit full HTML when it
  would make the tool input too large. The action can render representative
  screens from direction data. After the user picks, delete the unchosen
  variant screens before continuing from the kept screen.
- Use framework sharing actions for design and design-system visibility/grants.
- `/visual-edit` is a public entry route and public `/design/:id` links may
  render read-only public designs without a session. Do not open anonymous write
  actions: save, share, generation, localhost connection, and screen persistence
  should send signed-out visitors through `/_agent-native/sign-in?return=...`,
  then save or copy the design into the authenticated account before sharing.
- When the user asks to download/export, use export actions or point to the
  editor download menu.
- Design source modes are `inline`, `localhost`, and `fusion`. Inline is the
  current SQL-backed prototype mode. Localhost connections come from
  `npx @agent-native/core@latest design connect` and are persisted with
  `connect-localhost`; list them with `list-localhost-connections` before
  creating or resolving local-code artboards. Fusion designs are full-app
  designs backed by a running Builder Fusion container, created via
  `create-fusion-app` when `FULL_APP_BUILDING_ENABLED` is on; preserve the
  design's `fusionApp` linkage data whenever present and never invent it.
- Localhost route manifests are scaffolding for URL-backed Flow Canvas
  artboards. Use `add-localhost-screens` to place routes or path/query states as
  iframe screens in overview mode. Preserve route ids, paths, `sourceType`,
  bridge URL, and snapshot/state references when moving between actions so later
  flow-edge derivation has stable anchors.

## Application State

- `navigation` tells you the current view, design id, file id, and related UI
  state.
- `navigate` moves the UI and is auto-deleted after the client consumes it.
- `design-selection` includes active screen, selected element, overview mode,
  inspector tab, zoom, and screen list for the current tab.
- `design-generation-session:<designId>` contains agent-facing multi-screen
  generation planning state created by `generate-screens` (canvas region
  assignments and per-frame instructions consumed by `generate-design` and
  `view-screen`; not rendered as canvas overlays).
- `show-design-questions` opens focused pre-generation questions in the main
  design canvas (`show-questions` application state).
- `guided-questions` may contain a one-click chat choice for the current
  variant set. Variants themselves are normal design files with `canvasFrames`
  and `screenMetadata`.

## Code Layers

- `get-code-layer-projection` reads inline HTML/JSX and returns selectable layer
  nodes, selectors, names, and edit intents for agent and UI workflows.
- `apply-visual-edit` supports deterministic local edits for HTML-backed code
  layers: text, classes, styles, attributes, source order, and small structural
  changes. Use it for selected-element edits before falling back to full
  `update-design` / `generate-design` rewrites.
- For localhost React/TSX screens, treat compiler/debug metadata (project-relative
  source file, line, column, component, and runtime multiplicity) as evidence
  for locating source, not as permission to run a generic AST transform.
  Compiler tooling may verify an anchor, classify a literal edit, and validate
  syntax. Reparenting, grouping/ungrouping, wrappers, dynamic expressions,
  repeated `.map()` instances, shared components, and cross-file changes must
  be handed to the coding agent with both runtime relationships and exact
  source anchors so it can inspect the surrounding program semantics.
- A localhost React handoff must read each source file first, write with the
  exact returned `versionHash` as `expectedVersionHash` with
  `requireExpectedVersionHash: true`, re-read and re-plan on conflict, and leave the
  optimistic canvas preview in place until the dev server/HMR confirms the
  runtime result. Never report a semantic canvas change as persisted merely
  because it was submitted to the coding agent.
- Prefer `data-agent-native-layer-name="Readable name"` on meaningful elements.
  The projection uses it before semantic/text fallbacks, and layer renames should
  persist by updating that attribute.
- Inline/Alpine screens continue to use deterministic HTML code-layer edits.
  Localhost React/TSX screens use the semantic coding-agent handoff above;
  deterministic direct React writes remain intentionally limited to narrowly
  proven literal edits and never include generic structural transforms.

## Code Workspace

- The editor left rail has a wide `code` panel: a VS Code-style workbench
  (`app/components/design/code-workbench/`) with an explorer, workspace search,
  editor tabs, quick open (⌘P), a command palette (⇧⌘P), and a status bar. Open
  it with `navigate --view editor --designId <id> --leftPanel code` and
  optionally pass `fileId`, `filename`, or `screen` to focus a file.
- The explorer shows one root per workspace source: the design's SQL-backed
  files (`designfs://<designId>/`, backend `virtual-inline`) always, plus one
  root per localhost connection referenced by the design's screens
  (`list-local-files` / `read-local-file` proxy the `design connect` bridge;
  writes go through `write-local-file` and its user-approved consent grant).
- Inline design files are auto-formatted with Prettier the first time they are
  opened in the workbench and the formatted result is persisted; local files
  are never auto-formatted.
- Use `list-source-files` to inspect the inline source workspace and
  `read-source-file` for file contents; preserve its `versionHash` before
  writing. Do not return full file content from `view-screen`; it reports only
  active code file metadata and dirty state.
- Use `preview-source-edit` to show a diff without saving, then
  `apply-source-edit` with the prior `versionHash` to save either a full replace
  or exact replace. These actions update the same inline file state as the UI;
  agent edits show up live in open workbench buffers.
- Use `resolve-selection-source` when the user has a canvas element selected and
  you need the best matching inline file location/snippet.
- The workbench session (open tabs, active file, sidebar layout) persists per
  design in application state under `code-workbench:<designId>`.

## Localhost Source Actions

- `connect-localhost`: registers or refreshes a localhost source connection
  emitted by `npx @agent-native/core@latest design connect`. Pass
  `devServerUrl`, optional `bridgeUrl`, optional `rootPath`, and either `routes`
  or a full `routeManifest`.
- `list-localhost-connections`: lists the current user's saved localhost
  connections and route manifests. Use this before referring to local-code
  artboards.
- `add-localhost-screens`: creates or refreshes URL-backed iframe screens from
  the latest localhost connection or a specific `connectionId`. Pass `routes`
  with `path`/`url` when visualizing a flow; pass `paths` for a concise route
  list. Then call `navigate --view editor --designId <id> --editorView overview`.
- `write-local-file`: writes/patches a local file through the bridge, but only
  when a user-approved write-consent grant exists. Granting is human-only
  (`grant-localhost-write-consent` is hidden from agents), so you cannot approve
  it yourself.
- `request-localhost-write-consent`: call this when `write-local-file` fails
  with "no write-consent grant". It opens the write-consent dialog in the
  editor (or reports `alreadyGranted`). Tell the user to click "Allow writes",
  then retry `write-local-file`. Do not keep retrying blindly — the write stays
  blocked until the user approves.

## Review, Breakpoints, Screen States & Components

- **Review**: `run-design-audit` runs a read-only accessibility audit over a
  design's rendered HTML (missing alt/labels, tap-target size,
  focus-visibility, reduced-motion coverage, a contrast hint) and returns
  `A11yFinding[]`. `apply-a11y-fix` applies one deterministic inline fix for a
  finding (contrast, tap-target size, focus ring) when `fixAvailable: true`.
  `get-design-review` compares two design snapshots/branches and returns a
  file-level visual diff (added/removed/modified). See the `design-generation`
  skill's Phase 5 for when to run these.
- **Breakpoints**: `add-breakpoint`, `remove-breakpoint`, and
  `set-active-breakpoint` manage the design's device-width frame set and which
  frame new edits target. Breakpoint frames are one document with a
  Framer-style cascade (base = widest frame; narrower-frame edits persist as
  width-scoped overrides via `apply-visual-edit` + `activeFrameWidthPx`).
  Read the `responsive-breakpoints` skill before responsive edits.
- **Design states**: `create-design-state`, `apply-design-state`,
  `capture-design-state`, `list-design-states`, and `delete-design-state`
  manage named DOM/Alpine states (Loading/Empty/Error), static data fixtures,
  and live app captures. See the same skill section.
- **Components**: `create-component` promotes a selected element into a
  recognised reusable component; `index-components` scans a design's HTML for
  existing component annotations; `list-design-components` scans all HTML
  screens for swap targets; `get-component-details`,
  `preview-component-prop-edit`, `apply-component-prop-edit`, and
  `open-component-source` inspect, preview, persist, and navigate to a
  component instance. Use `go-to-main-component` to select the earliest known
  instance, `swap-component-instance` to replace an inline/Alpine instance
  while preserving same-named prop overrides, and
  `detach-component-instance` to turn an instance into plain editable markup.
  See the `design-generation` skill's "Component reuse" section — promote a
  3+ times repeated pattern instead of inventing another near-duplicate.

## Full App Building

Flag-gated (`FULL_APP_BUILDING_ENABLED` in `shared/full-app.ts`, default off)
and requires Builder connected. See `full-app-build` skill for the full flow.

- `create-fusion-app`: creates the app branch via the Builder cloud agent; one
  branch per design; returns existing linkage if already created.
- `sync-fusion-app`: boots/attaches the container; poll while building; on
  ready, updates `previewUrl` and upserts URL-backed screens.
- `add-fusion-screens`: places more routes as screens once `previewUrl` is
  known.
- `queue-fusion-edit`: queues one edit intent against a fusion screen.
- `list-fusion-edits`: inspects the queued edits.
- `apply-fusion-edits`: batches pending edits into one prompt for the app's
  in-container agent (fire-and-forget); marks them "sent".
- `send-fusion-message`: relays a freeform request to the app's coding agent.
- `push-fusion-app`: pushes the branch's code to its git remote.
- `deploy-fusion-app`: reserves `<slug>.builder.cloud` and triggers a deploy.
- `get-fusion-deploy-status`: polls deploy status until live/failed/canceled.
- Fusion screens are URL-backed iframes, same model as localhost screens.
  Never inline-edit a fusion screen's HTML or use `generate-design` /
  `edit-design` / `apply-visual-edit` on it — queue and dispatch edits
  instead. When not configured, actions return a connect CTA like
  `migrate-inline-design-to-app`; never throw or invent `fusionApp` data.

## App-Backed Skill Distribution

- The preferred hosted install path is
  `npx @agent-native/core@latest skills add design-exploration`,
  `npx @agent-native/core@latest skills add visual-edit`, or `design` for the
  full Design bundle. It installs the exported Design instructions and registers
  the hosted Design MCP connector together.
- The open Skills CLI path
  `npx skills@latest add BuilderIO/agent-native --skill visual-edit` installs
  exported instructions only.
- For local-code visual editing, `/visual-edit` should run the target app dev
  server, run
  `npx @agent-native/core@latest design connect --url http://localhost:<port> --root .`,
  register that manifest with `connect-localhost`, call `add-localhost-screens`,
  and open the editor in overview mode.
- For human-in-the-loop UI exploration, create a design shell, call
  `present-design-variants` with 2-5 concise directions (three by default),
  wait for the user to pick one in chat, delete each other generated variant
  screen with `delete-file` at most once, call `get-design-snapshot` exactly
  once with the selected screen's `fileId`, then call `edit-design` exactly once
  on that same `fileId` for follow-up refinement. The kept variant screen is a
  representative direction, not the final deliverable: use `mode:
"replace-file"` to replace it with the actual requested app/product UI in the
  chosen visual style. Keep the replacement complete but compact: prioritize
  the primary workflow, and if the requested feature list is too large for one
  reliable edit, represent secondary details as visible controls, states, or
  affordances instead of expanding the action input. Do not leave a direction
  board, variant brief, summary card, or prose description as the final screen.
  Do not repeat delete/snapshot cycles, and do not call `generate-design` after
  a variant pick.
- If inline chat choice buttons are unavailable, the user can tell you the
  preferred screen name. Do not show a separate variant picker or ask them to
  paste a copyable handoff summary.
