/**
 * connect-builder-app — return the Jami Studio connection state / CTA payload for
 * a design so the UI can render the appropriate inline card.
 *
 * This action intentionally does NOT start the OAuth / cli-auth flow; the
 * existing `connect-builder` agent-chat tool owns that flow and renders the
 * interactive card in chat.  What this action does instead:
 *
 * 1. Check whether Jami Studio is currently configured (credentials + project ID)
 *    via the shared `resolveBuilderStatus` helper (no credential values leak).
 * 2. Return a structured payload the UI can use to decide whether to render
 *    an "already connected" summary, a "connect to unlock" CTA, or a
 *    "Jami Studio enabled — ready to migrate" state.
 *
 * The `connectUrl` field is the pre-built URL that opens the Jami Studio cli-auth
 * popup from the current app origin (same shape the agent-chat plugin returns
 * in the `kind: "connect-builder-card"` tool result).  The UI should open this
 * in a popup and poll `/builder/status` for completion, matching the existing
 * connect flow.
 *
 * Gate: any design the caller can view is sufficient — the action is read-only
 * and returns only connection-level metadata, not design content.
