/**
 * Identity-authority logic for "Sign in with Agent-Native".
 *
 * Dispatch is the canonical identity authority. A first-party client app
 * (mail, calendar, analytics, …) bounces an unauthenticated visitor to
 * Dispatch's `/_agent-native/identity/authorize`. Dispatch reuses its EXISTING
 * Better Auth session + login flow, then mints a short-lived signed identity
 * JWT (the existing A2A signer) and 302s back to the client's `redirect_uri`
 * with the token + the caller's untouched `state`.
 *
 * This module holds the pure, side-effect-free pieces so they can be unit
 * tested in isolation:
 *   - `isAllowedRedirectUri`  — the single most important security control.
 *   - `buildIdentityClaims`   — the exact JWT claim set + TTL.
 *   - `buildRedirectLocation` — where the token + state land on the redirect.
 *
 * The HTTP wiring (session resolution, login bounce, signing) lives in
 * `server/plugins/identity-sso.ts` so this file stays trivially testable with
 * no Nitro / crypto / DB dependencies.
