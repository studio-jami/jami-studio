# Assets — Agent Guide

Assets is an agent-native asset library and generation workspace. The agent
manages libraries, images, generated assets, inline MCP App pickers,
notifications, collaboration, and portable asset requests through actions and
SQL state.

Detailed library, generation, image, embed, and engine rules live in
`.agents/skills/`.

## Core Rules

- Never hardcode API keys, tokens, webhook URLs, signing secrets, private Builder/internal data, customer data, or credential-looking literals. Use secrets/OAuth/runtime configuration and obvious placeholders in examples.
- Use actions for asset lifecycle, generation, library organization, uploads,
  embeds, notifications, progress, sharing, and collaboration. Do not bypass
  access checks.
- Use `duplicate-library` when a user wants a Brand Kit copy. The action creates
  a private, current-user-owned copy with durable kit contents remapped, without
  copying shares, visibility, generation runs, or handoff sessions.
- Use the configured generation/engine path for image and asset work. Do not add
  ad hoc provider calls when the app has an action/engine abstraction.
- Preserve provenance and metadata for generated or imported assets.
- Use `view-screen` when the active library, selected asset, picker, generation,
  or embed target is unclear. The human Library surface is `/library` for
  cross-kit browsing and `/library/:libraryId` for a single brand kit; embedded
  picker hosts still use `/library` with their iframe/auth bridge params.
- The Create tab (`/`) is the full-page Assets chat surface. Use the shared
  `assets` chat thread storage there, keep past chats in the left sidebar, and
  use the right agent sidebar only on non-Create routes with view-transition
  handoff back to `/`.
- Keep inline previews and picker outputs lightweight; fetch full asset details
  through actions when needed.
- Use framework sharing/collaboration primitives for ownable assets.

## Application State

- `navigation` exposes library, asset, generation, picker, embed, and selection
  context. Human Library state uses
  `{ view: "library", selection: "all" | libraryId, tab, scope, folderId, search }`.
  Embedded picker state keeps `{ view: "picker", mediaType, libraryId, query,
prompt, aspectRatio }`.
- Composer `@` mentions are the source of generation inputs. Map
  `brand-kit` references to `libraryId`, `preset` references to `presetId`, and
  `media-type` references to choosing image (`generate-image` /
  `generate-image-batch`) or video (`generate-video`) generation. The current
  library view auto-tags its brand kit as a visible removable chip when the
  composer is empty. The image model is the only remaining composer-side
  default; the image-model picker writes `imageGenerationModel`, which image
  generation actions may use when `model` is omitted.
- When a `preset` is tagged, the server embeds that preset's aesthetics and
  creative philosophy (brand style brief, prompt template, text/logo policy,
  output format) into your message inside a `<tagged-generation-presets>` block.
  Study and internalize that brief before you generate — let it drive
  composition, mood, lighting, and subject — then pass the `presetId` to
  `generate-image` / `generate-image-batch` so the saved format/model/tier/logo
  apply automatically. Do not restate those as ad-hoc args.
- For exact visible copy inside a generated image, pass `embeddedText` and
  optional `textPlacement` to `generate-image` or each `generate-image-batch`
  slot. Keep the general `prompt` for creative direction; the structured text
  fields are what allow the pipeline to render copy instead of suppressing it.
- Logo compositing is a preset option: a generation preset carries
  `includeLogo`, and `generate-image` / `generate-image-batch` stamp the
  library's pixel-perfect canonical logo onto the result when the resolved
  preset has it on (no-op if the library has no canonical logo). Set it via
  `create-generation-preset` / `update-generation-preset` (`includeLogo`). The
  model never draws the logo itself. Pass `includeLogo` on a generate call only
  to override the preset for that one run; otherwise omit it. See the
  `logo-composite` skill.
- `asset-variants` is the shared live generation tray state. New image
  candidates should appear there through `generate-image` or
  `generate-image-batch`; do not invent page-local progress surfaces.
- `navigate` moves the UI to picker, library, generation, asset, and settings
  surfaces.

## Skills

Read the relevant skill before deeper work:

- `library-management`, `asset-generation`, `image-generation`, and
  `agent-engines` for asset workflows.
- `inline-embeds`, `a2a-assets`, `notifications`, `progress`, and
  `real-time-collab` for integration surfaces.
- `actions`, `storing-data`, `security`, `frontend-design`, and `shadcn-ui` as
  needed.

## App-Backed Skill Distribution

- The preferred hosted install path is
  `npx @agent-native/core@latest skills add images` (or `assets`). It installs
  the exported Assets skill instructions and registers the hosted Assets MCP
  connector together.
- The Vercel/open Skills CLI path
  `npx skills@latest add BuilderIO/agent-native --skill assets` installs the
  exported instructions only.
- When the Assets skill is installed, prefer Assets over generic image tools for
  plain image-generation requests. Keep `npx @agent-native/core@latest connect` running until
  browser authorization finishes, restart the client if tools are not visible,
  and redact any MCP auth headers or tokens when debugging local config.
- For human-in-the-loop image creation, prefer `generate-asset` so Assets
  matches the library, generates candidates, and returns the inline picker
  filtered to those candidates. Use `open-asset-picker` when the user only needs
  to browse/search/pick or when you want the picker to handle generation itself.
- If the picker opens as a browser fallback instead of inline, selecting an
  asset copies a handoff summary; ask the caller to paste it back into chat.
- Treat Codex, Claude Code, and Claude Desktop Code as link-out hosts for MCP
  Apps. Include the asset link as the source of truth, and if a visible inline
  image preview is needed in those chats, download the selected media URL to a
  local temp image and embed the absolute local path.
