# Neon preview branches — per-PR database isolation

Preview deploys share the prod `DATABASE_URL` by default, so any server
cold-start that touches the database writes to prod. To isolate preview
deploys, we use Neon's copy-on-write branching via GitHub Actions.

## How it works

1. **PR opened/updated** — `.github/workflows/neon-preview-branches.yml`
   creates a Neon branch (`preview/pr-<number>`) for each hosted template's
   Neon project, then sets `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL` on the corresponding
   Netlify site's deploy-preview context.

2. **Netlify auto-deploys** — each template's `netlify.toml` build command
   starts with `export DATABASE_URL=${NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL:-$DATABASE_URL}`.
   When `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL` is set (preview), the build and runtime use
   the branch DB. When unset (prod), they fall through to the real
   `DATABASE_URL`.

3. **PR closed** — the workflow deletes the Neon branches and removes the
   `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL` env overrides.

`@agent-native/core` stays provider-agnostic — it only reads `DATABASE_URL`.
The Neon/Netlify specifics live in the workflow and each template's
`netlify.toml`.

## Required GitHub secrets

| Secret               | Where to get it                               |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `NEON_API_KEY`       | Neon dashboard → Account → API Keys           |
| `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` | Netlify User Settings → Personal Access Token |
| `NETLIFY_ACCOUNT_ID` | Netlify team settings → Team ID               |

## Restoring production env vars

Preview DB overrides are managed by GitHub Actions, but production template
secrets are not. If a Netlify project loses its env vars during a migration,
restore them from the local ignored template env files:

```bash
pnpm sync:netlify-env -- --template clips
NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN=... NETLIFY_ACCOUNT_ID=... pnpm sync:netlify-env -- --template clips --write
```

The script is dry-run by default, logs key names only, writes the production
context, and marks real secrets as Netlify secret values while leaving public
deployment metadata plain so Netlify's secret scanner does not block deploys.
It merges `templates/<name>/.env` and `templates/<name>/.env.local` because
some deploy-relevant auth keys, such as `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, currently live in
`.env.local`. Pass `--all` to restore every known template site.

## Schema changes

`drizzle-kit push` is **not** run in any build (removed after it caused
production data loss — see PR #252). Schema evolution uses `runMigrations`
in each template's `server/plugins/db.ts` — additive SQL only
(`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`).

## Follow-ups

- **Agent-Native Plans DNS/TLS.** The Plans Neon project and Netlify site are
  configured and included in the preview-branch workflows. To complete the
  public cutover, `plan.agent-native.com` should resolve as a DNS-only CNAME to
  `agent-native-plan.netlify.app`; then provision/verify TLS in Netlify.

- **PR visual recap publishing.** PR automation can publish org-gated visual
  recap plans to the hosted Plans app by default when `PLAN_RECAP_TOKEN`
  contains the publish token. Set `PLAN_RECAP_APP_URL` only for a self-hosted
  Plans app. Recap links are review aids; they do not replace the GitHub diff
  review.

- **Preview-only actions.** Actions that reach outside the DB (send email,
  charge a card, post to Slack) need their own preview-vs-prod gating so
  preview deploys don't trigger real-world side effects.
