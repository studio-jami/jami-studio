Agent SSE reconnect: replace the cryptic `run_terminal_event_missing` error with the friendlier stale-run message, and persist it back to SQL so future reconnects replay the proper terminal event instead of regenerating it. This path triggers when an `agent_runs` row was flipped to `errored` but the terminal event write was lost (e.g. a reaper's `appendTerminalRunEvent(...).catch(() => {})` swallowed a transient DB error). The user-facing situation is identical to a stale-run reap, so the UI now shows "The agent stopped before it could finish" with `recoverable: true` (offering retry) instead of the debug-string error.
