Agent run-store: stop the bug that caused the user-facing `run_terminal_event_missing` error from happening in the first place. The reaper paths (`reapIfStale`, `reapAllStaleRuns`, `cleanupOldRuns`, `markRunAborted`) used to call `appendTerminalRunEvent(...).catch(() => {})`, silently dropping transient SQL errors and stranding reconnecting clients with bare `status='errored'` rows. They now go through `safeAppendTerminalRunEvent` — one retry after a 100ms backoff, then a structured `captureError` to Sentry on persistent failure. `cleanupOldRuns` also broadens its terminal-event-append SELECT to cover the 24h-age UPDATE in addition to the heartbeat-stale one (an old run with a somehow-fresh heartbeat would previously be flipped to `errored` without a terminal event).
